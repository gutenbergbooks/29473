<h3>Bismarck&#8217;s Human Essence</h3>



<h4><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h4>

<h3>The Man Himself</h3>

<h5><a name="s1" id="s1"></a>1</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Hark, Hark! The giant&#8217;s ponderous hammer rings
on the anvil of destiny. Enter, thou massive figure,
Bismarck, and in deadly earnest take thy place
before Time&#8217;s forge.</p></div>


<p>&para; It is, it must be, a large story&mdash;big with destiny! The details
often bore with their monotony; they do not at all times
march on; they drag, but they do indeed never halt permanently;
ahead always is the great German glory.</p>

<p>&para; Forward march, under Prince Bismarck. He is our grim
blacksmith, looming through the encircling dark, massive
figure before Time&#8217;s forge.</p>

<p>The sparks fly, the air rings with the rain of blows: he is in
deadly earnest, this half-naked, brawny Prussian giant; magnificent
in his Olympian mien; his bellows cracking, his shop
aglow with cheery-colored sparks as the heavy hammer falls
on the unshapen ores on the big black anvil.</p>

<p>&para; Thus, toiling hour after hour in the heat and sweat, our
Pomeranian smith with ponderous hammer beats and batters
the stubborn German iron into a noble plan&mdash;for a great
Nation!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; From a human point, we do not always see the ultimate
glory.</p>

<p>For that is obscured by dark clouds of party strife, extending
over years, the caprices of men and the interplay of ambitions
both within and without the distracted German lands.
Russia, Austria, Italy, Great Britain, France, Spain, have
their spies engaged in all the under-play of political intrigue;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
there are a thousand enemies at home and abroad, in camp,
court and peasant&#8217;s cottage.</p>

<p>&para; And at times, weary of it all, we throw down the book convinced
that, in a welter of sordid ends, the cause is lost in
shame.</p>

<p>But, somehow, some way, Germany does in truth ultimately
emerge triumphant, in spite of her amazing errors and the
endless plots of enemies.</p>

<p>She does indeed justify her manhood&mdash;and thus the Bismarck
story is of imperishable glory.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We say that Bismarck had to re-inspire the Germans to be
a fighting nation.</p>

<p>What we mean is that the spirit of the ancient Teutons had
to be aroused; for though it slumbered for centuries, it never
died.</p>

<p>Rome found that out when she was still in her infancy; the
Germans burnt the town by the Tiber; and the fearsome
struggle between the Romans and the Germanic tribesmen
lasted almost unbroken for nearly five centuries.</p>

<p>&para; The Romans regarded the Germans as the bravest people
in the world.</p>

<p>The migrations of the Cimbri and Teutones, and the frightful
struggles in which after superhuman endeavors the
Roman Marius destroyed his German enemies is one of the
heroic pages of all history. It was a hand-to-hand contest,
and torrents of human blood ran that day. Menzel tells us,
(Germany, p. 85), that the place of battle enriched by a
deluge of blood and ultimately fertilized by heaps of the
slain, became in after years the site of vineyards whose
wines were eagerly sought by connoisseurs.</p>

<p>&para; The Cimbri were drawn up in a solid square, each side of
which measured 7,000 paces. The foremost ranks were fastened
together with chains, that the enemy might not readily
break through. Even the German dogs that guarded the
baggage train fought with animal ferocity. The battle went
against the Germans and the slaughter was frightful. When
all was lost, the Germans killed their women and children,
rather than see them fall into the hands of the Romans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
German courage inspired terror and created foreboding
throughout the Roman world. It is a heroic story and sustains
the German tradition that Germans born free under
their ancient oaks never will be slaves, though the whole
world is against them.</p>

<p>The success varied, but the Germans conquered, even in
death, becoming lineal descendants of the Empire. And on
the ruins were builded the German nation, as the successor
of the old Holy Roman Empire.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We picture to you these shadowy glimpses of remote
battle-scenes to show you that Germans were ever fighting
men, who preferred death to loss of liberty.</p>

<p>On the ruins of Roman imperial glory, Teutonic conquerors
founded an Empire that defied time and chance for upwards
of 1,000 years; then there crept in a peculiar dry rot. The
ancient German oak died at the top. Along came Napoleon,
hacking away the limbs and scarring the gnarled trunk with
fire and sword. The ruin seemed complete. Dead at the
top, dead at the root, men said. And what men say is true.
There is no longer a Germany, except as a mere geographical
designation; when you speak of the German Empire you
recall merely the echo of a once mighty name.</p>

<p>It now becomes Bismarck&#8217;s solemn duty, fortified by a noble
appreciation of the ancient legend, to make the German oak
green again in its immortal youth. And he watered the
roots with blood.</p>

<p>&para; We cannot tell you the great story in a few baby-sentences;
you must read and grasp the broad spirit as it gradually
unfolds. Bismarck in the crudity of his early inspiration
scarcely finds himself for years. But all the while he is holding
fast to the idea that the Fatherland should under God
be free and united, sustained by the ancient Teutonic brotherhood
in arms.</p>

<p>We present him in part as a tyrant, a wild, intolerant spirit,
working his own plans to be sure, but those plans in the
end are to redound to the good of the nation he long and unselfishly
serves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>We ask you to see him in his weakness and we hope with
some of his strength, always with his high purpose.</p>

<p>We ask you to behold him as a man with all a strong man&#8217;s
frailties and faults. We do not spare him. We paint him
black, now and then, deliberately, that you may know how
very small ofttimes are the very great; also to realize that
if we are to wait for perfect human beings to front our reforms
then those reforms will never be made.</p>

<p>Bismarck is too great a man to be belittled by the glamour
of spurious praise for spurious virtues.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for him to cease to be a human being
in order to carry out his work. He remained, to the end,
grossly human, for which the gods be praised.</p>


<h5><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>2</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Grossly human is our Bismarck, whose lust for control
is idiomatic; let us get this clearly, first of all.</p></div>

<p>&para; Did you ever see a bulldog battle with one of his kind?
The startling fact is this: The dog suddenly develops magnificent
reserve force, making his battling blood leap; is
transformed into a catapult, bearing down his adversary or
by him borne down&mdash;it matters not which!&mdash;for the joy of
battle. To fight is the realization of his utmost being.</p>

<p>&para; A peculiar fact known to all admirers of a fighting bulldog
is this: The dog during the fight, looks now and then at
his master near-by, as much as to say, &#8220;See how well I fight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Thus Bismarck looked at his King.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The nature of the pit bulldog is seen in Bismarck&#8217;s head.
His surly face inspires a sense of dread. There is that in
his physiognomy that shows his ugly disposition, when
aroused. If you saw that moody face in the crowd, one
glance would be sufficient to make you feel how vituperative,
short, sharp, murderous the unknown man could be, on
occasion.</p>

<p>&para; Yet the fear stirred by the sight of a pit bulldog is ofttimes
largely illusionary. The dog at heart is genial in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
brute way, and never a more loyal servant than the bulldog
to his friends&mdash;devoted even to death, to his master.</p>

<p>&para; It is the sense of dread in the bulldog&#8217;s head that strikes
home! So with Bismarck&#8217;s physiognomy. The Iron Chancellor
had but to come into the room to make his onlookers experience
uneasiness. There was an ever-present suggestion
of pent-up power, that could in an instant be turned upon
men&#8217;s lives, to their destruction!</p>

<p>&para; It is true that Bismarck had his genial side, but it cannot
be said that he drew and held men to him. He had thousands
of admirers to one friend. During the greater part of his
life he was either hated or feared&mdash;at best, misunderstood.
Like the pit bulldog, Bismarck was born to rule other lives&mdash;and
he fulfilled his mission.</p>

<p>&para; The element of absolutism in the man, his uncompromising
severity, his command of the situation regardless of cost,
sorrow or suffering to other men, is seen in his realistic
physiognomy. We study these facts more and more, as we
go along.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; There was always something imperious about this great
man. He brooked no interference. His excessive dignity
compelled respect. He never allowed familiarities; you could
not safely presume on his good nature. He never permitted
you to get too near. This abnormal self-confidence conveyed
the idea that this giant in physique and in intellectual power
was truly cut out for greatness.</p>

<p>One of his favorite pranks, as a boy, was to amuse himself
making faces at his sister; he could frighten her by his
queer grimaces.</p>

<p>From early youth, he was accustomed to take himself very
seriously, and by his offensive manners conveyed an immediate
impression of the ironical indifference in which he held
humanity, in the mass.</p>

<p>&para; He was a born aristocrat, in a sense of high, offensive partisanship.</p>

<p>&para; Men shrank from him, cursed him, reviled his name; but
they respected his intellect, even in the early days when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
used his power in an undisciplined way; yes, was painfully
learning the business of mastering human lives.</p>

<p>&para; The brute in the man loomed large; the unreasoning but
magnificent audacity of the bulldog expressed itself in scars,
wounds, deep-drinking bouts, fisticuffs, and in twenty-eight
duels.</p>

<p>&para; But he had another kind of courage, greater in import than
that expressed by physical combat.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; When we say Bismarck&#8217;s work is a revelation of his will
to power, we emphasize again how unnecessary it is to make
him either less or more than a human being. There is a
school of writers that never mentions his name except with
upturned eyes, as though he were a demigod. The tendency
of human nature is to idealize such as Bismarck out of all
semblance to the original, creating wax figures where once
were men of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>&para; Men rise to power largely in uniform ways; that psychic
foundation on which they draw is always grossly human,
rather dull when you understand it, always conventional;&mdash;and
the great Bismarck himself is no exception.</p>

<p>&para; In doing his work, Bismarck is following the psychic necessities
of his character; is acting in a very personal way, upheld
always by the soldier&#8217;s virtue, ambition. There is also
a large element of self-love. His idiomatic lust for control
is to be accepted as a root-fact of his peculiar type of being.
And while on the whole his ambition is exercised for the
good of his country, herein he is acting, in addition, under
the ardent appetite, in his case a passion, to dominate millions
of lives; urged not perhaps so much from a preconceived
desire to dominate as from an inherent call to exercise
his innate capacity for leadership.</p>

<p>&para; Making allowance for the idea that Bismarck is a devoted
servant of the King of Prussia, it is not necessary to believe
that Bismarck poses as the Savior of his country. In fact, he
distinctly disavows this sacrifice, has too much sense to regard
himself from this absurd point of view.</p>

<p>&para; The words carved on Bismarck&#8217;s tomb at his own request,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
&#8220;A Faithful German Servant of Emperor William I,&#8221; show
that however much other men were unable to comprehend the
baffling Bismarckian character, the Iron Chancellor himself
had no vain illusions.</p>

<p>&para; When he was 83 and about to die, the old man taking a
final sweep of his long and turbulent life, asked himself solemnly:
&#8220;How will I be known in time to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Fame replied: &#8220;You have been a great Prince; an invincible
maker of Empire, you have held in your hand the globe
of this earth; call yourself what you will, and I will write a
sermon in brass on your tomb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; But the Iron Chancellor, after mature reflection, decided
that his entire career, with all its high lights and its deep
shadows, could be expressed in four simple words, &#8220;A Faithful
German Servant.&#8221; He knew exactly what he was, and
how he would ultimately be represented in history.</p>

<p>&para; Think what this means. On those supreme questions of
Life and Time involving the interpretation of Destiny&mdash;a
problem hopelessly obscure to the average man&mdash;Bismarck
brought a massive mind charged with a peculiar clairvoyance;
often, his fore-knowledge seemed well-nigh uncanny in
its exact realism; and if you doubt this assertion, all we ask
is that you withhold your verdict till you have read Bismarck&#8217;s
story, herein set forth in intimate detail.</p>

<p>&para; How clear the old man&#8217;s vision to discern behind all his
Bismarckian pomp and majesty, in camp, court and combat,
only the r&ocirc;le of faithful servant.</p>

<p>&para; The phrase on his tomb proclaims the man&#8217;s great mind.
His overbrooding silence, as it were, is more eloquent than
sermons in brass.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; In studying Bismarck, the man, we merge his identity in
the events of his time; but we must sharply differentiate between
the events and the man. We incline to the belief that
hereditary tendencies explain him more than does environment.
It is Bismarck as a human being, and not the tremendous
panorama of incidents leading to German sovereignty
that always holds our interest. Life is life, and is
intensely interesting, for its own sake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, we are at once freed from a common fallacy of biographical
writing&mdash;that vicious mental attitude, as vain as it
is egotistical on part of the over-partial historian, who would
warp some manifest destiny on human life.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck needs no historical explanation, no reference to
hackneyed categories in the card-index of Time. Whether
his plan was dedicated to this world or to the glory of some
invisible God, you may debate as you will, but Bismarck will
be neither greater nor less because of flights of your
imagination.</p>

<p>&para; He is a great man in the sense that he did large things,
but this does not make him other than he is, nor does his
story lose because we know him to be grossly human in his
aims. His life does not borrow anything because a certain
type of mind professes to see behind Bismarck&#8217;s history, as
indeed behind the careers of all great men, some mysterious
purpose apart and beyond human nature&#8217;s daily needs. It
was not necessary for Bismarck to cease to be a human
being, to accomplish what he accomplished.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Also, for the reason that Bismarck was a genius, he is an
exception to conventional rules covering the limitations of
little men.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck was a born revolutionist. Look at his terrible
jaw, which, like the jaws of the bulldog, when once shut down
never lets go till that object is in shreds.</p>

<p>&para; He was a true bulldog in this that, like the thoroughbred
bulldog, Bismarck favored one feed a day. He took a light
breakfast, no second breakfast, but at night would eat one
enormous meal.</p>

<p>The bulldog follows a similar practice, when eating never
looks from the plate, and the water fairly runs from his eyes,
with animal satisfaction.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck compelled men to do his bidding&mdash;as the wind
drives the clouds and asks not when or why. It is enough
to know that that is the wind&#8217;s way!</p>

<p>He knew the coward, the thief, the soldier, the priest, the
citizen, the king, and the peasant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew how to betray an enemy with a Judas kiss; how to
smite him when he was down; how to dig pitfalls for his
feet; how to ply him with champagne and learn his secrets;
how to permit him to win money at cards, and then get him
to sign papers; how to remember old obligations or to forget
new favors; how to read a document in more than one way;
how to turn historical parallels upside down; how to urge
today what he refused to entertain a year ago; how to put
the best face on a losing situation; and how to shuffle, cut and
stack the cards, or at times how to play in the open.</p>

<p>&para; He was not a humanitarian with conceptions of world
peace or world benevolences. He was for himself and his
own ends, which were tied to his political conception of a new
Germany.</p>

<p>&para; And all the time he was helped out by his extraordinary
vital powers, his ability to work all night like a horse week
after week; go to bed at dawn and sleep till afternoon; then
drive a staff of secretaries frantic with his insistent demands.</p>

<p>&para; Likewise, he was helped out by his remarkable personality.
Actor that he was, he sometimes gained his point by his
frankness, knowing that when he told the exact truth he
would not be believed.</p>

<p>&para; Also, he could bluff and swagger, or he could speak in the
polite accents of the distinguished gentleman; he could gulp
a quart of champagne without taking the silver tankard from
his lips; in younger years he used to eat from four to eleven
eggs at a meal, besides vegetables, cakes, beer, game and
three or four kinds of meats; his favorite drink was a mixture
of champagne and porter.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; He was a chain-smoker, lighted one cigar with another,
often smoked ten or twelve hours at a stretch. His huge
pipes, in the drawing room; his beer, in the salons of Berlin;
his irritability, his bilious streaks, his flashes of temper; his
superstition about the number 13; his strange mixing of
God with all his despotic conduct; his fondness for mastiffs;
his attacks of jaundice; his volcanic outbursts; his belief in
ghosts, in the influence of the moon to make the hair grow;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
his mystical something about seven and combinations of
seven; his incessant repetition of the formula that he was
obeying his God&mdash;were but human weaknesses that showed
he had a side like an everyday common man.</p>

<p>&para; On top of it all he was great, because he knew how to manage
men either with or without their consent; but he always
studied to place himself in a strategic position from which
he could insist on his demand for his pound of flesh.</p>

<p>&para; Sometimes, it took years before he could lull to sleep, buy,
bribe or win over the men he needed; again when the game
was short and sharp, he kicked some men out of his path contemptuously,
others he parleyed with, still others he thundered
against and defied; but always at the right time, won
his own way.</p>

<p>&para; Yes, even Bismarck&#8217;s card-playing is subordinated to the
shrewd ends of diplomacy. Dr. Busch, the press-agent of
Bismarck during the Franco-Prussian war, tells us that Bismarck
once made this frank confession:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;In the summer of 1865 when I concluded the Convention
of Gastein with Blome (the Austrian), I went in for quinze
so madly that the rest could not help wondering at me. But
I knew what I was about. Blome had heard that this game
gave the best possible opportunity for discovering a man&#8217;s
real nature, and wanted to try it on with me. So I thought
to myself, here&#8217;s for you then, and away went a few hundred
thalers, which I really might have charged as spent in His
Majesty&#8217;s service. But at least I thus put Blome off the
scent, so he thought me a reckless fellow and gave way.&#8221;</p>



<h5><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>3</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Despite vast areas of political bogs, quaking under
foot, that one must traverse, our Otto is not inaccessible!</p></div>

<p>&para; For many years they hate him like hell-fire itself, this
Otto von Bismarck. The Prussians hate him, the Austrians,
the Bavarians, to say nothing of the intervening rabble; but
our tyrant is strong enough, in the end, to win foreign wars,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and then the haters veer about, almost in a night, come up
on bended knees and kiss the hand that smites&mdash;that hand
of Bismarck, at once the best-beloved and the most-hated
hand of his time. What more pray do you ask of human
nature?</p>

<p>&para; Now here is a strange reality: If you look at the general
outlines of the German map in 1815, you will see that the
frontiers trace in a startling way the scowling outlines of
Frederick the Great, &#8220;Old Fritz,&#8221; who first dreamed this German
unity idea.</p>

<p>But mighty Frederick is in the royal tomb these many years;
and a new Frederick in spirit is rapidly learning the business
of king-maker and empire-builder.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Behind the name Bismarck is a story extraordinary, compounded
of the intrigues, blood and passions of Austria, Russia,
Italy, France, Belgium, Bavaria, Spain, and England.</p>

<p>Volumes would not suffice to give you the bewildering details;
mountains of diplomatic letters, orders, telegrams, truths,
half-truths, shuffling, cutting and stacking; you go confusedly
from palace to people, prince to pauper, university to prison
pen&mdash;all the way from Waterloo to Versailles, where William
I received at last his great glory, German Emperor.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s story is best told in flashes of lightning&mdash;as you
try to picture a bolt from the black skies.</p>

<p>By the patience of the methodical historian who laboriously
examines each document in the National archives, one fills
soon enough a ten-volume account&mdash;with a swamp of cross-references,
footnotes to each paragraph, and with notes to
the footnotes.</p>

<p>&para; Yet this Bismarck is not inaccessible if we get at his inner
side, grasp the man&#8217;s essence.</p>

<p>Strong arm and tireless brain Time asked;&mdash;a man who could
neither be bent, broken nor brow-beaten; a man who would
for 40 years follow a plan by no means clear; often had to
go out in the dark and find his way, all old landmarks lost,
and no pole-star in sight.</p>

<p>&para; I dwell on one outstanding fact, all down through his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
career: I mean Bismarck&#8217;s power to conceal pain. Hurricanes
of insulting criticisms swept around his head, year
after year, but on the whole Otto&#8217;s attitude was that of the
mountain that defies the storm. He would never give in
that, as it seemed to onlookers, a shaft of disagreeable truth
had struck home; that a soft-nosed bullet, well aimed, had
torn his flesh or broken a bone; or that a dagger-thrust, going
directly through his coat of the White Cuirassier had
pierced his heart.</p>

<p>&para; Even in his bitter defeats, he had a peculiar idiomatic way
of making out that the result was exactly what he desired.
It was of course only an adroit explanation to protect his
pride; the brazen invention of a nature that would not
acknowledge itself in error. Here is Bismarck, to the core.</p>

<p>&para; For a long and turbulent life-time Bismarck&#8217;s soul was
tried by the very tortures of the damned!</p>



<h5><a name="s4" id="s4"></a>4</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wherein it is set forth that Otto von Bismarck&#8217;s
massive political genius, combined with his personal
foibles, mark him as a heroic figure, side by side
with Frederick the Great.</p></div>

<p>&para; In attempting to depict a consistent Bismarck, we find that
his life has been as much misinterpreted through the carping
need of envious political critics as through the bad art
of historically well-disposed friends.</p>

<p>The perplexing problem is to blend his massive mental grasp,
side by side with his strange fits of irritability, his turbulence,
his deep-drinking, his gluttony, his wild pranks.</p>

<p>About him at all times, whether expressed or concealed, there
floated an ironic derision of the littleness of the average man,
whom at heart Bismarck despised.</p>

<p>While the eyes of detractors are everywhere, the voice of
hero-worship has likewise conspired to make an impossible
idol of a man with very human and ofttimes crying frailties;
the biographic truth is to be found somewhere between these
two extremes; but even with this clear clue in mind, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
often difficult to reconcile amazing personal and diplomatic
inconsistencies with which his career abounds.</p>

<p>&para; Then, too, there is something that strikes like the irony
of Socrates, only bitter instead of light; and Bismarck reveals
now and then a touch remindful of that Rabelaisian
hero whose enormous capacity could only be quenched by
draining the river dry. To tell Bismarck&#8217;s inner life-story,
in a large way, one must often deal with a series of pictures
akin to the gods and devils in Dore&#8217;s delineations for Dante&#8217;s
&#8220;Inferno.&#8221;</p>

<p>It often seems as though every important act of this great
man&#8217;s life was charged with the significance of Destiny,
stands forth vividly against a background of intrigue, superstition,
personal follies, the smoke and flame of battle&mdash;a
heroic figure side by side with such master-spirits as Frederick
the Great.</p>

<p>Like Frederick the Severe, this Bismarck is very human indeed,
and has his crying weaknesses, and his enemies, God
knows, tried for forty years to get rid of him by intrigue,
often by assassination; yet until his great duty is done he
must hold firmly to his place, must do the work which brings
him no peace, or rest, only trouble year after year.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Throughout the amazing story, no matter which way we
travel, we always return to a profound sense of this giant&#8217;s
will and his massive knowledge of human life, expressed in
his ability to force the shrewdest men in Europe to do his
bidding.</p>

<p>His sense of power is so supreme that sometimes it really
seems that, as Bismarck himself often sets forth, his authority
fell from heaven.</p>

<p>Here, there is a direct harking back to the ancient days in
the Alt Mark, to the Circle of Stendal with its little town of
Bismarck, on the Biese, where stands the ancient masonry
dating from 1203, and known as the &#8220;Bismarck Louse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The strange legend of the Bismarck Louse tells worlds of
the ancient Bismarck power, in those far-off times, helps us
in the year 1915 to grasp certain obscure phases of the Bismarck
racial strength, inherited by Otto von Bismarck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; This medieval Bismarck Tower received its name from a
gigantic louse which inhabited this place, and had to be fed
and appeased; therefore, every day the superstitious peasants
of the district brought huge quantities of meat and drink,
for the monster&#8217;s food. It is needless to add that these visits
were encouraged by the Bismarck lord of the soil, in Alt
Mark;&mdash;and here you see already the cunning in managing
human nature so characteristic of the Bismarck genius.</p>

<p>&para; The purely social application of this gossip may, however,
be eyed with suspicion, as a French canard. It was so easy
for &#8220;Figaro&#8221; to libel the Bismarck of 1871, whereupon the
whole French press followed and barked at the Iron Chancellor&#8217;s
heels.</p>

<p>He was caricatured, spit at, reviled, depicted as the beast-man
in Europe.</p>

<p>&para; For one thing, Bismarck knew France was the richest nation
in Europe, also that she had ambition for the left bank
of the Rhine; and to General Sheridan, who chanced to be at
Sedan and Gravelotte on official business, Bismarck said,
&#8220;The only way to keep France from waging war in the near
future is to empty her pockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; French newspaper editors lashed themselves into insanity
trying to invent new names for the man who had brought
the downfall of the Empire, at Sedan; the man who at Versailles
was arranging the hardest terms of peace ever conceived
by a diplomatic Shylock, bent on having his pound of
flesh.</p>

<p>&para; Paris journalists called him &#8220;the incarnation of the evil
spirit,&#8221; &#8220;the Antichrist,&#8221; &#8220;the shrewd barbarian,&#8221; &#8220;crime-stained
ogre, who was always thrashing his wife with a dog-whip,&#8221;
&#8220;he kept a harem, from which no Berlin shopkeeper&#8217;s
daughter was safe;&#8221; &#8220;once he became enamored of a nun and
hired ruffians to kidnap her and bear her away to his castle;&#8221;
&#8220;he is the father of many illegitimate children, in Berlin
some say as many as fifty;&#8221; &#8220;he once lashed one of his Russian
mistresses over the bare shoulders because he suspected
her of looking at another admirer;&#8221; &#8220;he uses his confidential
diplomatic knowledge to add to his huge private fortune by
gambling on every Bourse in Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; How magnificent&mdash;if it were indeed only true! What a
relief that would be over the tame details of average human
life, and what a boon to biographers this grand wickedness!
Alas, the tales are only important as specimens of French
drawing room gossip of 1871!</p>

<p>&para; The fables never bothered Bismarck a moment. When he
was ready, he repaid them in his own splendid coin; and certainly
he was past-master of the gentle art of putting a
razor-edge on an insult!</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck had his vituperative side. Egged on by his wife
and his son, Bismarck became at times verbally ferocious.
His wife, a descendant of those terrible Frankish women-warriors,
stemming from barbarian times, could under stress
exercise a barbarian&#8217;s stark freedom of speech; and when
Bismarck, furious at some insult, was replying with a political
cannonade, she would infuriate him to still greater exertions
by suggesting:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Bismarck, hiss a little! Hiss a little!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; And after seven hundred years, the Bismarck psychology
behind the old Tower&#8217;s superstitious appeal remains substantially
the same. We shall see at times as we sketch for you
the life portrait of Otto von Bismarck a mysterious atavism;
the self-same mental astuteness that stood his ancestors in
such good stead, enabling them to frighten the peasants into
providing the corn.</p>

<p>&para; Yes, blood will tell&mdash;and the Bismarck blood is rare juice!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Battle-born, Bismarck&#8217;s genius springs from the
very fire and sword of human nature&mdash;resembling
definitely his iron-headed barbarian ancestry, whose
freedom remained unconquered through the centuries.</p></div>


<p>&para; We cannot hope to trace Bismarck to any complete legal
basis&mdash;any more than we can defend the complete legitimacy
of France, Belgium, or the United States, countries avowedly
harking back to revolutionary origin. Bismarck&#8217;s life, likewise,
presents unquestioned elements of anarchistic root. Inherited
from battle-born Bismarcks are forces peculiar to
himself, free, and individualistic, profoundly expressive
wherein Mother Nature summoning her ultimate powers endows
a colossal courage in a colossal mind and body.</p>

<p>&para; As far as the Thirteenth Century, the name Bismarck, then
styled Bishofsmarck or Biscopesmarck, is associated with the
little river Biese; but whence the original stock is for antiquarians
to debate.</p>

<p>Believe the Bismarcks to be of Bohemian, of Frankish or of
Jewish origin, or of Slavic if you will, you find bespectacled,
scholastic authorities who will open the musty pages and
display to you the truth.</p>

<p>&para; Herbort of Biese became in due course Herbort von Bismarck.
The &#8220;von&#8221; was unquestionably a mark of geographical
origin, rather than a sign of nobility. The name is borne
by other families from Biese; but the important part is not
the name but the men behind that name, what that name
stood for.</p>

<p>&para; Herbort von Bismarck&#8217;s name is enrolled in the guild papers
as master of the merchant tailors of Stendal, in the old Mark
of Brandenburg; a &#8220;Mark&#8221; being somewhat equivalent to
an English &#8220;shire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; But this fact about the tailor-ancestor must not be pressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
too far. Some antiquarian of the year 2700 A.&nbsp;D., let us
say, might argue that President Taft was a steam-shoveler,
because the name is found recorded among the laborers who
helped dig the Panama Canal; whereas, the fact is that the
President was enrolled as an honorary member of one of the
labor unions.</p>

<p>Also, after Waterloo, when the British nation was running
wild trying to imagine some distinction that as yet had not
been bestowed on Wellington, the London tailors in a moment
of inspiration added the Iron Duke&#8217;s name to the great
roll of scissor-snippers!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Beginning with Herbort&#8217;s son, four Bismarcks, in three
generations, were social lepers.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Klaus von Bismarck died about the year 1385, outside the
holy favor of the church&mdash;as his father had died before him,
and as did two sons, in their turn. But Klaus, ever shrewd
in a worldly way, recommended himself as a king&#8217;s fighting
man; led the robber gang off with the loot in the name of
his merry monarch, the Margrave of Bavaria.</p>

<p>&para; For this most excellent service as a professional man-killer,
Klaus was rewarded with a knight&#8217;s fee of forest land, at
Burgstal, an estate that remained in the family for two hundred
years. There were deer, wild boar, wolves and bear in
the Bismarck forest, and one day Conrad of Hohenzollern
came that way on a royal hunting expedition.</p>

<p>&para; Conrad could have stolen the Bismarck petty title outright,
but while he confiscated Burgstal forest, he offered Schoenhausen,
on the Elbe, in exchange. However, Schoenhausen
did not compare with the estate that the envious monarch
took by force. The Burgstal forest is to this day one of the
great game preserves of the German Emperor.</p>

<p>&para; The Bismarcks also received in the exchange farming land
known as Crevisse, lately confiscated by the Hohenzollerns
from the nuns; and one of the conditions of the transfer to
the Bismarcks was that these nuns should be supported.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Strong animal basis of Bismarck&#8217;s rise to Power&mdash;The
story is always the same, &#8220;Fight, or die like a
dog!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&para; Thus, from time immemorial, the fighting Bismarcks wrote
their title to a share of this earth with the sword, which in
spite of all Hague Conferences remains the best sort of title
man has been able to devise.</p>

<p>As time sped and what is called Civilization grew somewhat,
men took on chicken-hearted ways; and in every pinch appealed
to courts for decisions formerly decided by individual
brawn; till finally, as in these latter degenerate days, if a
fight becomes necessary, society hires policemen to stop the
row.</p>

<p>&para; Klaus von Bismarck preferred to do his own murdering,
and consequently, Klaus stood first in the eyes of honest men
of his own generation; but in this Twentieth Century, instead
of putting incompetents to the test of the sword, society,
committed to the soft doctrine that all life is sacred, burdens
itself with lengthening the days of the daft. A far cry that
from the ideals of the early Bismarcks! It is well to keep
these facts in mind, in contemplating the extraordinary career
of the great Otto von Bismarck, king-maker and unifier
of Germany.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Modern timid-hearted folk, reading of the desperate makeshifts
of the old Bismarcks to get on in the world, would say
off-hand, &#8220;There must be a strain of madness in the Bismarck
brain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Unquestionably! This fighting family in each generation
had its born revolutionists, its enormous egotists, its men
who lived what orthodox opinion calls &#8220;godless lives&#8221;&mdash;although
in their own philosophy the Bismarcks are always
preaching that God is on their side. When the Elector decided
to steal Burgstal forest, the Bismarcks set up this pious
plea: &#8220;We wish to remain in the pleasant place assigned to
us by the Almighty.&#8221; Four hundred years later we find Otto
von Bismarck using again and again this peculiar reasoning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to justify, at least to explain, his own career: &#8220;If I were
not a Christian, I would not continue to serve the King
another moment. Did I not obey my God and count on Him,
I should certainly take no account of earthly masters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; In three great wars of ambition in which 80,000 perished,
he repeated this solemn formula about God; he repeated it
on the blood-drenched field of Koeniggraetz; he repeated it
in the Holstein war, and he repeated it again at Sedan and at
Gravelotte.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck persisted in this peculiar conception of life, down
to the last. While in retirement, after his downfall, one
day the bloody past rose before him like a dream, and he
exclaimed to Dr. Busch: &#8220;Politics has brought me vexation,
anxiety and trouble; made no one happy, me, my family nor
anyone else, but many unhappy. Had it not been for me,
there would have been three great wars less; the lives of
80,000 would not have been sacrificed; and many parents,
brothers, sisters and wives would not now be mourners. That,
however, I have settled with my Maker!&#8221; Now, once and for
all, what we understand this to mean is merely this: a super-abundance
of faith. Many great leaders have had it&mdash;David,
Cromwell, Bismarck.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; In seeking biographic clues, through hereditary influences,
we are impressed with the astounding animal-basis of
strength behind the Bismarcks, from earliest recorded history.
They were a deep-drinking, prolific gormandizing race,
and every mother&#8217;s son had to do battle by brawn backed by
the sword, or die like a dog! This bred high tempers, turbulent
manners and contempt for the weak.</p>

<p>&para; Soldiers, diplomatists, brow-beaters, characterized the Bismarck
clan down through centuries. Stormy and adventurous
Bismarcks fought for the sheer delight of doing battle;&mdash;it
mattered not, whether against the Turks or against
some near-by king whose lands the German robber-knights
lusted for and wished to annex by appeal to the sword.</p>

<p>&para; There is a story of a garrison brawl in which a Bismarck
slew his companion in drink, then fled to Russia, then on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Siberia; soldier of fortune, he fights under any flag that
promises a gay life and plenty of loot. Three hundred years
later&mdash;how the wheel turns round!&mdash;Otto von Bismarck, as
Russian Ambassador to the King of Prussia, engaged in intrigues
for the same old lust of land, the same old nefarious
business, but this time sprayed over by the high-sounding
name, diplomacy.</p>

<p>&para; Dr. Busch, the Saxon press-agent for Prince Bismarck, repeats
the old tale of the winning of Alsace by the French
king, through the aid of Otto von Bismarck&#8217;s great-great-grandfather,
a mercenary soldier; adding that while one Bismarck
helped take Alsace away, another of that redoubtable
family brought it back many years later, with the added
joy of the prodigious money-fine of five billions of francs!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Boisterous Col. Bismarck, of the Dragoons; &#8220;The
Wooden Donkey dies today!&#8221; French Cavalier Bismarck
and his mushy prose-poems.</p></div>

<p>&para; Burly strength and horse-play, rather than diplomacy, were
always distinctive traits of that part of the Bismarck family
immediately surrounding Otto von Bismarck; and in Otto&#8217;s
case, although the years gradually taught him that there
are more ways of stopping a man&#8217;s mouth than by cutting
off his head, on the whole we seek in vain, among ancestral
Bismarcks, for any striking characteristics in which the
point does not turn either on gluttony or on deep-drinking.</p>

<p>&para; They were enormous eaters. Bread and meat were not
enough. They must have game, fish, cake, wines, and plenty
of each. Hunger put them in a rage. They were iron men,
with stomachs of pigs.</p>

<p>&para; They were unbrooked master spirits, followed the hounds,
fought duels, had noisy tongues, and gloried in personal independence.</p>

<p>When they loved they loved madly; when they hated it was
the same. They drank all night and were out again at dawn.</p>

<p>&para; Yet in their way, they were high-minded gentlemen, devoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
themselves industriously to their duties; and it may be
that the turbulence of their lives borrowed something from
the rude clash of opinion that often divided the best friends,
during the stormy periods of history in which they fought
as soldiers of fortune.</p>

<p>&para; Otto von Bismarck&#8217;s great-grandfather, Augustus, calling
his cronies of the barracks around him, was wont to add
zest to the carousal by introducing the trumpet call after
each toast; to heighten the infernal racket, the boisterous
colonel of dragoons ordered a volley fired in the drink-hall.</p>

<p>&para; This terrible dragoon, master of the hounds, guzzler, companion
and leader in all revels, was generally voted one of
the amiable men in army circles. He was a noted shot. In
one year of record his score was 154 red deer and 100 stag.</p>

<p>&para; At the Ihna bridge was a ducking stool, for army punishments;
it took the amusing style of a wooden donkey, and
was so called by the dragoons as a rude joke.</p>

<p>After one of his hard drinking bouts, it was often the
colonel&#8217;s amusing habit to order his men to march to the
bridge; on arriving the band struck up and the wooden donkey
was thrown into the stream. &#8220;All offenders of my regiment
are forgiven,&#8221; Bismarck would bawl, &#8220;the donkey dies
today!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then with all manner of opera bouffe the offending donkey
would be put overboard&mdash;only to be brought out next morning,
ready for official business.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; But our fun-loving colonel&#8217;s good times were now over. As
commander of the gallant Anspach-Bayreuth dragoons, Augustus
fought for Frederick the Great and was severely
wounded at Czaslau. Austrian hussars surprised the transport
wagons carrying the wounded to the rear, and with brutality
common to the soldier-business of that rude day killed
the defenseless Prussians, among whom was our Colonel von
Bismarck.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s grandfather, Karl Alexander, leaned toward the
namby-pamby intellectual rather than to the social and convivial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
He is remembered for his affected poetical style.
Karl, brave soldier, attracted the eye of no less a judge of
valor than the Great Frederick, who appointed this Karl
Alexander von Bismarck an attache of the Prussian embassy
at Vienna.</p>

<p>&para; Karl, like other Germans of the sentimental period, aped
the French poets; but when a German is sentimental, the
mush-pots boil over. Karl&#8217;s writings show that peculiar over-inflated
quality, &#8220;sentimentality,&#8221; so much admired in the
rococo period.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Karl William Ferd., Otto&#8217;s father, and Louise Wilhelmina,
Otto&#8217;s mother, born Mencken, lived at Schoenhausen in
troublous French times. Oct. 14th, 1806, the terrible defeat
at Jena put Prussia in the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>Fortresses surrendered without firing a shot, and the panic-stricken
king fled to the far eastern side of his domains, near
Russia.</p>

<p>All this took place within three months after the marriage of
Karl and Louise, who had now set up housekeeping at
Schoenhausen.</p>

<p>&para; The Bismarcks tried to escape in a coach, but the French
unexpectedly appeared and ordered Karl back to the house.
The French ransacked every room; Louise fled to the library
and locked the massive oak door; to this day it bears the
marks of French bayonets; the Bismarcks then hid in the
forest where they remained all night with panic-stricken
neighbors; at dawn Karl and Louise ventured out, to find
Schoenhausen a scene of destruction.</p>

<p>&para; The one galling fact that Karl could not overlook, in Marshal
Soult&#8217;s raid, was the desecration of the genealogical tree.
This huge painting with its shields of the Bismarck descent
was slashed from end to end, with bayonets!</p>

<p>&para; Oh, Otto von Bismarck remembered this many, many years
later, in making terms with the French after Sedan&mdash;do not
for a moment forget that! Such is the amazing power of
hereditary loves and hates;&mdash;and certainly the Bismarcks
had no reason to admire the French.</p>

<h3>The Gothic Cradle</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Idyl of the child Otto, in his huge Gothic cradle at
Schoenhausen; wonders that gather &#8217;round his destiny,
a forecast and a reality.</p></div>


<p>&para; Otto Edward Leopold von Bismarck, the great central
figure in our story, was the fourth of six children, three dying
in infancy. He was born April 1, 1815, but a few months
before the crowning defeat at Waterloo&mdash;that year big with
the hammer-blows of Destiny!</p>

<p>&para; In lonesome Schoenhausen on the Elbe, the village lately
devastated by Marshal Soult and his plundering soldiers, the
infant Otto sleeps peacefully in his oak-carved Gothic cradle.
A century later, we still see that huge cradle as one of the
souvenirs in the famous Bismarck museum at Schoenhausen.</p>

<p>&para; Schoenhausen house is one of those thick-walled monuments
of medi&aelig;val masonry.</p>

<p>There is, to be sure, something out of drawing about the
antiquated three-story house; and we survey with respect for
the past the queer courtyard, leaded panes, park with the
artificial island, wooded byways, and old forest, and not
far away is the village church with the square stone tower;
hard by, also, the kattenwinkel, or Katte&#8217;s corner, at the confluence
of the Havel and the Elbe; and on the house is the
Katte&#8217;s coat-of-arms, a cat watching a mouse, the mark of
the sturdy 17th century builder, Katte, who to honor his wife,
Dorothea Sophia Katte, added her name to his builder&#8217;s sign
over the lintel.</p>

<p>&para; In this historical 1815, seed-time and harvest strangely
blend, yet are years apart.</p>

<p>For, while the child sleeps in his Gothic cradle, the Congress
of Vienna meets to redistribute among the hungry kings the
old domains stolen as prizes in the long Napoleonic wars;
and in turn, after incredible political adventures, running
over years, the child before us, grown to be a man, will smash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the rulings of Vienna and will build an empire stronger far
than that of imperial France, now dying at Waterloo.</p>

<p>&para; All these wonders gather &#8217;round the destiny of the child in
the big Gothic cradle, before which we now tiptoe at Schoenhausen,
lest we awaken the baby and he cry.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; When the French overrun Prussian territory the old land-owning
military aristocracy was reduced to bankruptcy.
Mortgages falling due could not be paid; the king extended
credit for four years; and in the interim Prussians were
forced to use depreciated rag-money; all the gold and silver
had been confiscated by the French invaders.</p>

<p>&para; Great dissatisfaction followed. The farms had been tilled
by feudal-laborers, practically slaves; these oppressed peasants
now flew to arms.</p>

<p>Schoenhausen was a dreary place indeed; while the Bismarcks
were better off than their neighbors, still the times were out
of joint and ruin fell over the broad acres.</p>

<p>&para; Then came an unexpected change. Along about 1816, Karl
inherited Kneiphof, Kuelz and Jarchelin estates from his
cousin, moved to Kneiphof, just east of the hamlet of
Naugard.</p>

<p>The house was exceeding modest; a brook, the Zampel, ran
near by; and there was a carp pond. Karl was fond of
hunting in the old beech forest. Such were the unsettled conditions
in the Bismarck family, up to Otto&#8217;s sixth year.</p>



<h5><a name="s9" id="s9"></a>9</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Soft-hearted Karl and Spartan Mother Louise; her
rigid character, its good and its bad side; her extreme
punctilio and her pistol-shooting, to steady
her sight.</p></div>

<p>&para; Otto von Bismarck inherited his tall form from his father,
Karl William. This unusual type of cavalry captain subscribed
for French journals and ate off silver plate. Karl&#8217;s
regiment was known as the &#8220;White and Blue,&#8221; and one of
his duties was to get up at 4 in the morning and measure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
corn for horses. At one time the captain lived in Berlin, but
he soon tired of the capital and gladly returned to the country
where he passed his days as squire. To the end of his
life, he was fond of horseback riding and hunting; and he
brought his sons up to ride like centaurs.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s mother, Louise Wilhelmina Mencken, married at
the age of sixteen; her husband Karl was nineteen years her
senior.</p>

<p>&para; In the family circle, the father was known as the heart,
the mother as the brains; but in Louise&#8217;s case it might well
read &#8220;ambition.&#8221; She wished to see Otto von Bismarck, her
youngest son, become a diplomatist&mdash;a judgment that in the
light of after years seems almost uncanny.</p>

<p>Later, at the full tide of the Chancellor&#8217;s great glory, frequently
his earliest friends used to say, &#8220;Bismarck, had your
mother only survived to see this day!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The wife&#8217;s leading trait was her inflexible resolution, the
will to rulership;&mdash;and rule she certainly did, always.</p>

<p>For one thing, she steadied her nerves and schooled her sharp
eyes by practising pistol shooting.</p>

<p>There was Spartan courage about her decisions! Frau Bismarck&#8217;s
irritability had been growing of late; Karl was too
soft with Otto. She was angered to think that her husband
might spoil Otto, by too much coddling. The domestic climax
came.</p>

<p>&para; That day at table, Otto with childish impatience, began
swinging his legs like a pendulum. The good-natured Karl
hadn&#8217;t it in his heart to correct the child, but instead began
making excuses for Otto&#8217;s conduct. This aroused Louise&#8217;s
ire. To smooth matters Karl said, &#8220;See, Minchen, how the
boy is sitting there dangling his little legs!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Louise then and there read her ultimatum. She would not
have her son spoiled by the foolishness of his soft father&mdash;not
at all! She would send her beloved son away, first. At
the time, Otto was only six years old.</p>

<p>And she thereupon proceeded to keep her decision&mdash;acting
with all the aggressiveness for which in later life Otto von
Bismarck was himself celebrated.</p>

<h3>Sunshine and Shadow</h3>


<h5><a name="s10" id="s10"></a>10</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wherein is shown the amazing power of hereditary
traits; history repeats itself.</p></div>

<p>&para; It was from his mother that Prince Bismarck, the future
ruler of Germany, received his endowment of dauntless audacity,
his gift of trenchant argument, his bursts of ironical
laughter, his power of instant decisions, his scolding, and his
bitter wrath. All these qualities shone in the parliamentary
fight before the Austrian war, when for three years he defied
the country, and raised the Prussian war-funds by extortion!</p>

<p>&para; In one sense, he was always stacking the cards! And what
chance has the fellow-player against the dealer with the
marked deck? Bismarck&#8217;s life abounds with episodes showing
this astonishing readiness. In love, in laughter and in
intrigue, it was ever the same. Bismarck&#8217;s use of human nature,
constructively, at the precise psychological moment, redounding
to his self-interest, is supreme.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; At the wedding of his friend Blankenburg to Fraulein
Thadden-Triglaff, the bridesmaid was Fraulein Johanna von
Puttkammer. Bismarck saw, admired and decided. Soon
after in a Hartz journey, with the Blankenburgs, Otto had a
brief opportunity to favor energetic measures. He wasted
no time, Johanna must become his wife! He wrote direct to
the young lady&#8217;s parents, with whom he was not acquainted.
A flying visit followed to the home of his intended father-in-law.
The Puttkammers were surprised at the suitor&#8217;s impetuous
love-making, also were shocked by the reputation
Bismarck had for fast living.</p>

<p>The moment he saw parents and daughter he forced the
situation. Throwing his arms around his sweetheart, Bismarck
embraced her, vigorously. And thus he won his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bride even before an unwilling father and mother; for Bismarck
carried them off their feet by the very audacity of his
wooing.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; During the Franco-Prussian war, coming to the Rothschild
ch&acirc;teau, Bismarck found 17,000 bottles of wines in the cellar,
under lock and key; and the keeper was determined that Bismarck
should not use the master&#8217;s champagnes.</p>

<p>It took Bismarck only a few minutes to change all that.
Soon he was comfortably settled in the Baron&#8217;s private chambers,
reached by a grand winding staircase; here the Chancellor
proceeded to make himself at home in dressing gown
and slippers.</p>

<p>&para; He rang for the butler, ordered wine for himself and suite.
The keeper of the cellar still refused&mdash;and Bismarck&#8217;s black
ire rose. In a voice of thunder he cried, &#8220;If you do not open
that cellar door by the time I count five, you will be trussed
on a spit, like a fowl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; After that, the Prussians had what they wanted, made
merry on the rare wines of Baron Rothschild, who was known
as a hater of Prussia and an admirer of Austria.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck now decided to try various gastronomic oddities;
ordered his staff to shoot pheasants from the Baron&#8217;s preserves,
and commanded the cook to stew the birds in
champagne!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; When Napoleon wrote his famous note, at Sedan, &#8220;Not having
been able to die in the midst of my troops, there is
nothing left for me but to place my troops in your Majesty&#8217;s
hands,&#8221; Bismarck saw the human nature side at a glance!
He urged peace, then and there, with the Prince Imperial on
the throne, and &#8220;under German influence,&#8221; which would thus
give to Prussia the whip hand. General Sheridan tells the
story.</p>

<p>It was an instantaneous look into the far future, and although
it did not prevail, for certain important reasons, the Chancellor
caught the human side of the combination, with the
clarity of a dramatist constructing a plot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; On his mother&#8217;s side, Otto von Bismarck comes of hunting,
fighting and farming stock.</p>

<p>Shrewd, wise, ambitious, and haughty&mdash;with these traits she
richly endowed her son. His father was handsome, bright,
solid, emphatic-looking, but with a yielding disposition; the
iron will and sharp tongue of the wife overawed the husband.
The shrewish frau had things largely her own way, was able
to read a lecture like the wrath of God. However, on the
whole, the couple got along passably well&mdash;for Karl never
took Louise too seriously! When Frau Louise&#8217;s efforts to
make a lackey of him got on his nerves, Karl called his
cronies and away they went fox-hunting.</p>



<h5><a name="s11" id="s11"></a>11</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At the tender age of six, already is Otto forced out
of the family circle; the wolf&#8217;s breed shows its teeth.</p></div>

<p>&para; Well, the incensed Louise, weary of the softness of Karl,
and fearing lest Karl would spoil Otto by too much petting,
packed the child off to Plamann Institute, Berlin, a school of
the Squeers type.</p>

<p>Otto remained in this Spartan school-prison for nearly six
years, and to the end of his life carried unpleasant memories.
Plamann Institute idea was to harden lads, but instead of
hardening the practices there embittered.</p>

<p>&para; The half-starved boys were up at 6; breakfast of bread and
milk; religious exercises at 7; at 10, luncheon of bread and
salt; then, a run in the garden; at noon, dinner from the
hands of Frau Plamann; and if a lad wanted a second plate,
and couldn&#8217;t eat it all, he was punished by being sent to the
garden, there to remain till he had gulped down the last
morsel, even though he fairly choked; at teatime, bread and
salt, or warm beer and slices of bread; all day, studies of interminable
length and dullness;&mdash;but, best of all, fencing
exercises wound up the day.</p>

<p>&para; In the school yard was a lone lime-tree, and here the boys
came running as a goal for their sports. Using this lime-tree
as a pulpit, Otto used to read to his companions chapters
from Becker&#8217;s stories about giants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; There was a pond near Schoenberg where the pupils used
to go bathing. Otto&#8217;s chum was Ernest Kriger.</p>

<p>&para; After six years of this life on salt and potatoes, Otto was
transferred to Dr. Bonnell&#8217;s Frdk-Wm. Gymnasium, Berlin,
and in another year to Grey Friars&#8217; Gymnasium. Soon after
Dr. Schleiermacher confirmed Otto, at Trinity Protestant
church.</p>

<p>In the light of subsequent history, it is significant, almost uncanny,
to recall the life-text offered to Otto at this solemn
moment by his pastor: &#8220;And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily,
as to the Lord, and not unto men.&#8221; Many years later&mdash;just
before his death&mdash;Bismarck ordered the motto to be carved
on his tomb; all his life he had followed the text.</p>

<p>&para; The lad was two years at Grey Friars&#8217; school. While there
Otto&#8217;s deep-seated hatred of the French is again visible for a
decisive moment.</p>

<p>In 1806 Marshal Soult had slashed the genealogical tree of
the Bismarck family; and young Otto, who often heard the
story, grew up with the idea that the French were ogres.</p>

<p>The school schedule, among other studies, called for French,
or English as an optional selection; although all Otto&#8217;s chums
decided for French, the lad flatly refused to follow and instead
stood almost alone in the English class.</p>

<p>&para; He is no longer a child when he says good-bye to Grey
Friars; he is a young man of 17&mdash;and life is opening before
him.</p>

<p>Life! The joyous care-free life of youth and inexperience;
with the world and its cares still seemingly far away!</p>


<h5><a name="s12" id="s12"></a>12</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At Goettingen, he joined the Hannovera Corps and

<p>&para; Otto&#8217;s mother, who had strong social aspirations and held
to the rigid exclusiveness of the upper classes, wished to send
her son to an aristocratic university. So she selected Goettingen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Her ideas were to make her son a man of dignity

<p>Alas, he became but an indifferent student, excelling principally
in dueling, beer-bouts in college taverns, dog-fighting,

spent considerable time in the college dungeon. Listen to
this:</p>

<p>&para; Many years ago, in his roaring student days, long before
Otto von Bismarck was famous, he received an invitation to
a ball, and went to the shoemaker to be measured for high-topped
military boots, affected by the beaux of that day.
Calling some days later, he was told that it would be impossible
to get them finished in time; and he would therefore
have to wear his old boots to the ball.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck scowled and going back to his rooms, whistled for
his two ferocious dogs with which he was wont to trail
around town; returning to the cobbler&#8217;s the daring rascal said
in a loud voice: &#8220;Mister bootmaker, at a signal from me the
dogs will tear you to pieces! I am here to tell you, in the
most friendly way in the world, that it is absolutely necessary
to have my boots on time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck then went away, but he hired a man to parade
up and down in the vicinity of the shop with the two mastiffs;
and now and then this man dropped in, and in a voice
of sorrow, said to the cobbler: &#8220;My master has a terrible
temper and I am sorry for you.&#8221; At that, the shoemaker
told his wife: &#8220;Frau, I am going to work all night, to get
Herr Bismarck&#8217;s boots finished in time for that ball!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; It is needless to add that young Bismarck had his boots on
time.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; In discussing Bismarck&#8217;s life and personality many writers
will tell you that the man is inconsistency itself; advocating
now what in a year he will recant; that for this and other
reasons it is baffling to try to make a picture many-sided
enough to portray adequately his complex life.</p>

<p>&para; On the contrary, Bismarck, once you get the biographic
clue, is as open, free and direct as the light of the noonday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
sun. And the story of the poor cobbler and the boots is all
there is to it!</p>

<p>Repeat this story in a hundred and one forms, and the same
man is always behind.</p>

<p>&para; Among his cronies, he early gained the name &#8220;The Mad
Bismarck.&#8221; At Goettingen university, Otto fought 28 duels
and his face bore his fighting scars.</p>

<p>&para; To scare the girls and to make them shriek and lift their
skirts, a sight that the rascal Otto enjoyed, one night at a
dance he let loose a small fox in the ball room! And he had
ridden like the devil, some 30-odd miles to be at this dance.</p>

<p>&para; As for drinking, no man could put him under the table.
Later in life, he invented his own special draught, a combination
of champagne and porter; ordinary men dropped
under the deadly compound as from a dose of cyanide of
potassium, but Otto could drain his quart without taking
the tankard from his lips. He soon had all the company
under the chairs, like dead soldiers.</p>

<p>&para; Often, at country houses, he fired pistols to awaken guests
in the morning.</p>

<p>&para; His groom fell into the canal, the young giant Bismarck
leaped in and dragged the drowning man to safety;
for this heroic deed, Bismarck won his first medal.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s student life was tempestuous. He was indeed
full of the very devil.</p>

<p>His every-day get-up comprised top boots, long hair flowing
over the collar of his velveteen jacket; a big brass ring on
the first finger of his left hand; two fierce mastiffs trotted
sullenly at his side. He trailed around, smoking a long pipe.</p>

<p>&para; The young man&#8217;s high animal spirits broke all restraints;
he smoked, he drank, he sang, he flirted, and he fought; but
as for books, he did as little studying as he could.</p>

<p>He was sent many times to the university &#8220;carcer&#8221; or prison;
an interesting souvenir is still to be seen at Goettingen, the
student-prison door, on which Bismarck carved his name in
1832, when he was &#8220;doing&#8221; ten days for acting as second in
a pistol duel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; With a Mecklenburg student, Otto&#8217;s great chum, a trip
was made through the Hartz mountains, and on returning
a wine dinner was offered to other students.</p>

<p>All the fellows drank too much brandy. Bismarck made an
inflammatory speech, at table, ending by showing his derision
of scholasticism by hurling ink bottles out of the window.
For this breach of the rules, he was hauled before the
university court. Here, he appeared in outlandish get-up,
jack boots, tall hat, long pipe, dressing gown&mdash;and coolly
asked the proctor what &#8217;twas all about. Bismarck&#8217;s huge
dogs, with which he was always accompanied, frightened the
proctor half to death! Bismarck was promptly fined five
thalers for his absurdities; he paid the fine and began studying
up more deviltry.</p>

<p>&para; Joining the Hannovera Corps of fighting men, Otto was
soon known as &#8220;Achilles,&#8221; leading the fellows in all sword-play.
He fought duel after duel, and finally under the influence
of Morley, an American student, decided to switch
over from the Hannovera to the Brunswick corps&mdash;whereon
every Jack in the Hannovera sent Otto a challenge.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; On a trip to Jena, the fellows decided on a riot, and were
deep in their cups when the Goettingen proctor arrived to
bring the runaway Bismarck back, and put him in the &#8220;carcer&#8221;
till he cooled off. The Jena fellows carried on at a
great rate to think that the beloved &#8220;Achilles&#8221; had to leave
so unceremoniously, but at the last moment hitched up six
horses and paraded Bismarck around town, as a demonstrative
fare thee well!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The scene of many of his drinking bouts was &#8220;Crown&#8221;
tavern, an ancient Goettingen resort, where the fellows sat on
wooden benches in front of a long bar and drank till they
felt like fighting cocks. By the way, it is a bit strange that
Otto had such amazing capacity; for he was as thin as a
knitting needle.</p>

<p>Among the men Bismarck met at this bar was Albrecht von
Roon, who many years later was to become the great Prussian
military drill-master.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Bismarck finally left Goettingen in August, &#8217;33; his last
duel was with an Englishman who had made fun of the
German peasant, describing that worthy as &#8220;a dunce in a
night cap, whose night-dress is made of 39 rags.&#8221; The 39
rags was an allusion to the 39 petty German states. Bismarck
was already becoming imbued with the &#8220;national German
faith,&#8221; as it was called, and could not let the insult
go by.</p>

<p>&para; As a rule, Bismarck was lucky in his sword play. The biggest
slash he received was made by Biedenweg, whose sword
broke and cut Otto from jaw to lip, on the left cheek&mdash;a scar
that Bismarck carried to his grave.</p>

<p>&para; Giesseler, the proctor, gave Bismarck a very doubtful letter
of recommendation; the duelist and beer-drinker had asked
for a transfer to Berlin university. Otto wanted to hear law
lectures by Savigny.</p>

<p>&para; He began his Berlin course in a mocking way. There was
an unserved jail sentence hanging over Bismarck&#8217;s head at
Goettingen; and with sham seriousness, as though he were
going to turn over a new leaf, Otto humbly set up that, to
be strictly honest with the professors, to jail Otto must go
and to jail they sent him! But no sooner was he out than
he forgot all his good resolutions, and began his mad existence
again.</p>

<p>&para; Finally, in May, 1835, he passed his examination in law,
or &#8220;advocate assistant,&#8221; but not without hiring a professional
&#8220;crammer&#8221; to drill him hours and hours&mdash;to make up for
wasted weeks in beer cellars and with the pretty girls.</p>



<h5><a name="s13" id="s13"></a>13</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Deficient in discipline, young Otto makes a fizzle of
his first office-holding; his shocking conduct against
his superior officer; back to the old estates, he looks
after the cattle, dogs and horses.</p></div>

<p>&para; Harum-scarum days are over&mdash;and now for the serious
business of life. Years later, in the days of his great renown,
Bismarck, thinking of his early preparation, always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
regretted, he said, that he did not join the army. As a
matter of fact, he had no serious plans for years to come&mdash;and
it would appear that, on the whole, his career was decided
by accident. Of this more, at the right time, later.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; When Bismarck was 20, he served several months at Aix-la-Chapelle,
in court work, then was transferred to Potsdam,
to the administrative side.</p>

<p>He soon showed himself deficient in discipline. An over-officer
kept him waiting, and Bismarck took personal offense.
At last Bismarck was admitted. The over-officer was sitting
there, calmly killing time smoking a cigar. Bismarck leaned
over and in his gruff way asked, &#8220;Give me a match!&#8221; This
in itself was highly insolent, a violation of Prussian ideas of
discipline. But the astonished over-officer complied. The
young clerk thereupon sprawled in a chair and lighted his
cigar.</p>

<p>It was, you see, merely to show his independence. Also, it
meant that he had to get out of the service.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck was glad to go; he hated intensely the clock-like
regularity of the Prussian bureaucracy.</p>

<p>&para; His mother died in 1839, at which time Otto was 24; and on
the young chap now fell the management of the Pomeranian
estates.</p>

<p>&para; In 1844, Otto went to live with his father at Schoenhausen;
here, Otto and his brother looked after the farms. Otto was
later appointed Dyke-captain of the Elbe.</p>

<p>&para; Along about this time, a religious revival swept through
Prussia and Otto was carried away on the flood; also, he began
showing himself a strong monarchical man.</p>

<p>Always religious and always a King&#8217;s man, at heart, Otto
now seriously studied religion and state affairs. When the
call came, he was not found wanting!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We hasten along. In 1847, Otto&#8217;s naturally deep religious
convictions were strengthened by his wife&#8217;s uncompromising
orthodoxy.</p>

<p>&para; It was in this year, also, that he made his entry into Prussian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
politics&mdash;to the study of which he was to devote his
long life and his surprising genius. However, to present a
clear idea of the work Bismarck was to do, it is necessary
to return, briefly, to an earlier day, and to trace a complex
historical movement through the past. We shall summarize,
on broad lines, the problem presented by the question of
German national unity. The German problem comprised a
political, sociological and racial situation toward whose solution
hundreds, if not thousands, of notable men and women,
for several generations past, had sought in vain.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Nothing,&#8221; says Wilhelm Gorlach, &#8220;can more clearly prove
Bismarck&#8217;s historical importance than the fact that we are
obliged to go back several centuries to understand the connection
of his actions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<h5><a name="s14" id="s14"></a>14</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The German crazy-quilt, of many hues and colors,
and how this blanket was patched and mended
through the years.</p></div>

<p>&para; From the 18th Century, and indeed before that time, to
say nothing of years to come as late as 1871, there was in
fact no Germany. The term was a mere geographical &#8220;designation.&#8221;
We shall hear more of this, as Bismarck assumes
the stupendous task of German unity, in a real sense of the
word; but we will never understand what Bismarck and other
statesmen who hoped for German unity had to deal with, unless
we take a broad survey of conditions in Germany from
the year 1750; not only from the political but also from the
social and domestic side, as represented in 300-odd German
principalities that like a crazy-quilt were thrown helter-skelter
from Hamburg on the North to Vienna on the South.</p>

<p>&para; Many of the holdings were gained through musty papers
from rulers of the ancient Holy Roman Empire, a nation Voltaire
declared &#8220;neither holy, nor empire, nor Roman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; There were free cities, great landlords, and there were
great robber-barons&mdash;thieves of high or low degree.</p>

<p>&para; At Cologne, Treves and Mayence archbishops held the lower
valley of the Moselle, also some of finest parts of the Rhein
valley.</p>

<p>&para; Next, came dukes, landgraves, margraves, cities of the Empire,
and then still smaller, duchies in duodecimo, down
through some 800 minor landlords who as the owners of
some borough or village walked this earth genuine game
cocks on their own dunghills. Political conditions were distressing;
old feuds, old hates prevailed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>There were restrictions on commerce, statute labor, barbarous
penal laws, religious persecution and Jew-baiting.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; In short, to make 300-odd jealous princelings join hands
in national brotherhood is the complex problem that goes
down through the years; generation after generation; till at
last the one strong man appears, Otto von Bismarck, who in
his supreme rise to power sees clearly that the only hope
for Germany is in a complete social and political revolution,
in which the changes in the German mind concerning political
unity in governmental affairs must be as unusual as the
transformations in the German mode of life.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; During the early part of the 18th Century, of which we are
now writing, a certain bold political doctrine still stood unchallenged.
It had come out of the dim and hoary past, and
in effect it proclaimed the power of the fist. For centuries
unnumbered the idea prevailed that a state defends itself
against foreign foes, and otherwise conserves its existence
through the direct will of a strong ruler, preferably a king
brought up in arms.</p>

<p>Thus the &#8220;genius of the people&#8221; meant in effect the wisdom
or the ignorance of the line of kings.</p>

<p>Under this theory, Prussia by slow degrees and through
many sacrifices of blood and treasure, had become a great
power.</p>

<p>&para; Fred: Wm. I., (1713-40), who was indeed a miser and a
scoffer, freed little Prussia from debt and rebuilt cities
ruined by the wars. He likewise established a system of
compulsory education, made schoolmasters state officers, and
contributed mightily to a higher standard.</p>

<p>And he went further still: he welcomed religious exiles from
other parts of Germany; he settled thousands of immigrants
on the raw lands; he saved his money, economized to the
last pfennig, was prudent in a worldly sense, and to the end
of his life remained intolerable foe of idleness.</p>

<p>&para; It was from this severe master that the Great Frederick
(1740-86) learned the trick of laying his cane over the backs
of peasants and crying out in rage: &#8220;Get to work!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Old Fritz continued his line of battle from 1740 to 1763, in
various unequal contests with the Allies. He fought Austria,
France, Russia, Sweden, Saxony, and Poland, and for a while
he fought their allied strength. The upshot was that
Prussian enemies at home and abroad were defeated and
Prussia won first rank as a military and political power.
This idea of military discipline, united with large worldly
sagacity in the management of state affairs, marks and explains
Prussia&#8217;s rise to power.</p>

<p>&para; But the decline was equally manifest under Fr: Wm. II,
the Great Frederick&#8217;s nephew. Although he inherited a domain
of six millions of people, banded under an excellent
administrative system, sustained by the disciplined army of
&#8220;Old Dessauer&#8221; (Prince Leopold), and although Fr: Wm. II
found the huge sum of 40,000,000 thalers in his fighting
uncle&#8217;s treasure chest, yet within a few years all these
splendid advantages were frittered away in idle dalliance
and the weak king found himself twenty millions in debt.</p>

<p>By the time he died, 1797, Prussia was riding to a fall; and
disregarding plain measures for her own safety, she had
reached the sad place where the sturdy old Prussian spirit
of prudence and independence had become so compromised
that Prussia almost deemed it unessential to preserve her
own political life!</p>

<p>&para; Thus, within three generations, Prussia repeated the old
story of human life, wherein the weak descendant eats up
the strong sire&#8217;s goods. Frederick the Great died Aug.
17th, 1786. Within three years, France struck at the German
lands; and within 20 years the old Constitution of the
Empire was scoffed at by encircling enemies along the
frontiers, led by France, while at home political disputants
destroyed National spirit by exciting revolution after revolution.
&#8220;Everywhere,&#8221; says Zimmermann, (Germany, p.
1618), &#8220;one felt the morning breeze of the new dispensation.&#8221;
The cry of the people had to be answered, and the common
man wanted to know not only &#8220;Why!&#8221; but &#8220;When!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; For the ensuing 85 years clamor, disruption and disunion
continue often accompanied by bloodshed; till through Bismarck&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
great work over which he toiled for 40-odd years,
came the final answer of the Imperial democracy, 1871.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It is to be the labor of years with confusion worse confounded,
as we go along. The Feudal system, with which
Germany has been for centuries petrified, must be thrown off;
the peasant laborers freed in some sort, whether social or
political, the absurd restrictions of countless customs houses
walling-in each petty principality, must be destroyed. Before
a new Germany may emerge, if Germany is to emerge at all,
a National faith must be stimulated, fighting blood stirred,
wars waged. Then, and then only, may this idea of German
Unity, long the puzzling mental preoccupation of the fathers,
become a geographical actuality and a political fact.</p>

<p>&para; The German peasants&#8217; sense of respect for vested authority,
even when held by hated kings, made the common people of
the various German states almost ox-like in their patience
under harsh political conditions.</p>

<p>Between the power of petty tyrants and of foreign despots,
there was no freedom worthy of the name.</p>

<p>The German lived for himself, aloof, suspicious, not caring
particularly to change his condition.</p>

<p>Compromise after compromise, failure after failure, sorrow
after sorrow must be recorded in the great story; but do not
despair. In amazing manner, through blood and iron, Otto
von Bismarck, our blond Pomeranian giant, will face, fight
and finally conquer the bewildering cross-forces of his time&mdash;till
&#8220;German national faith&#8221; is supreme.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Paying no attention to its neighbor, each German state
stood off by itself; each princeling had his army, in some
instances only 25 men; each ruler had his castle, in imitation
of Versailles; each state its custom house, its distinct court
and rural costumes.</p>

<p>To go ten miles north or south was to find yourself in a new
world; you could scarcely understand the mush-talk of the
peasants, whereas the various Liliputian courts chattered in
mongrel French, aped from Versailles.</p>

<p>&para; The minor courts of Germany imitated the excesses of Versailles;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
had dancing teachers from Paris, French barbers,
French governesses, and French prostitutes.</p>

<p>Every young man of wealth was sent to Paris to acquire
what was called &#8220;bon ton,&#8221; that is to say, familiarity with
the vices of the day; the etiquette of the fan and the study
of new ways to spend money wrung from over-taxed peasants
of German provinces was also regarded as very important.</p>

<p>Even to speak German was held a mark of vulgarity; and
what more despicable than to be ashamed of one&#8217;s ancestry?</p>

<p>&para; Unmoved by the sufferings of the peasants, Augustus III
of Saxony applied himself to grand operas, written by queens
of French society. While the peasants were living like
beasts, Frederick Augustus, the successor, spent his time
hunting red deer. The dukes of Coburg and Hildburghausen
were miserable bankrupts. As a result of social excesses,
Charles VII of Bavaria left a debt of forty millions. Charles
Theodore, in some respects an enlightened monarch, is particularly
remembered for three strange facts: That he once
gave an opera in German and not in French; that he tried
to sell off Bavaria, his inheritance, and move to a more congenial
locality; and third, that he hired Rumford, the great
chemist, to invent a soup, at low cost, to feed the poor, whose
miseries had been growing on account of the bad government.</p>

<p>&para; Nor should we overlook the monarch at Zweibrucken, the
Pfalzgraf Charles. His mania took the form of collecting
pipes and toys, of which he had innumerable specimens from
the ends of the earth. He kept also one thousand five hundred
horses and a thousand dogs and cats. Every traveler
had to take off his hat and bow at sight of the spire, on pain
of being beaten by the Count&#8217;s constable.</p>

<p>&para; Charles Eugene, of Wuertemberg, slave to luxury, played
pranks when he was not indulging in vices. He liked to
alarm peasants at night with wild cries; and when a woman
stuck her head out of the window, the monarch would throw
a hoop and try to drag her outside. In a deep forest he built
his castle &#8220;Solitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; On his 50th birthday, he wrote to his subjects, promising
to mend his life; the letter was read in all the churches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The people decided that he was in earnest, promised him
more money, of which he was in sore need. His first step
was to contract a left-handed marriage with Francisca von
Bernedin, whom he raised to the rank of countess.</p>

<p>&para; His next step was to build a queer bird-cage for his new
mate. Menzel says of this episode: &#8220;Records of every clime
and of every age were here collected. A Turkish mosque
contrasted its splendid dome with the pillared Roman temple
and the steepled Gothic church. The castled turret rose by
the massive Roman tower; the low picturesque hut of the
modern peasant stood beneath the shelter of the gigantesque
remains of antiquity; and imitations of the pyramids of Cestius,
of the baths of Diocletian, a Roman senate-house and
Roman dungeons, met the astonished eye.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Another amiable peculiarity of French-mongering German
princelings in their petty monarchies, was man-stealing.
Hard-pressed for funds, the practice was to kidnap peasants
and sell them into foreign military service. The vile trade
was dignified by court authority; followers of the game were
known as &#8220;man merchants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The Wuertemberg monarch in order to raise funds to complete
the absurd castle for his mistress, took it into his head
to sell 1,000 peasants to the Dutch, for the war in the Indies;
and so deep lay the curse of tyranny that no public
protest was raised. It is true that Schiller, the noble poet,
who at this time was a student at Charles College, fled in
disgust, but Schaubert, another poet, was not so fortunate;
he was seized and imprisoned for ten years.</p>

<p>&para; The vile practice of man-stealing from the wretched peasantry
long continued as a monarchical privilege. The Landgrave
Frederick of Hesse-Cassel, on one occasion sent 12,800
Hessians to the British, to fight in America. English commissioners
came over and inspected the captive men as
though picking out stock at a cattle show. Should a parent
protest, a son, a wife or a widow, the answer was the lash.
Hanau furnished 1200 of these slave-soldiers, Waldeck several
hundred. Seume, who was himself a victim to the system,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
deported to America, tells us in his Memoirs: &#8220;No one
was safe; every means was resorted to, fraud, cunning,
trickery, violence. Foreigners were thrown into prison, and
sold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a Hessian prince of high distinction,&#8221; says Huergelmer.
&#8220;He has magnificent palaces, pheasant-preserves,
at Wilhelmsbad, operas, mistresses, etc. These things cost
money. He has, moreover, a hoard of debts, the result of
the luxury of his sainted forefathers. What does the prince
do in this dilemma? He seizes an unlucky fellow in the
street, expends fifty dollars on his equipment, sends him out
of the country, and gets a hundred dollars for him in
exchange.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Frederick of Bayreuth expended all his revenues in building
a grand opera house, for giving balls, parties, receptions
and official functions to aristocrats. His successor
Alexander fell under the sway of Lady Craven, a British adventuress,
who led the peasants a merry chase for the cash;
man-stealing was the old game; and one order alone from
the British government called for 1,500 peasants.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; But why continue the recital of man&#8217;s inhumanities?</p>

<p>Charles of Brunswick, a spendthrift, who sold subjects into
captivity, paid his ballet-master 30,000 a year. Frederick
of Brunswick on one occasion sold 4,000 peasants to Britain,
for the army.</p>

<p>&para; The terrible famine of 1770-72 added to the discontent of
the common man, throughout Germany; he began to feel
that it was the duty of kings to feed the hungry; bark,
grass, leaves, carrion were eaten; disease spread; emigrations
depopulated the Rheinlands; 20,000 left Bavaria alone; while
upwards of 180,000 Bavarians died of hunger; in Saxony, the
number that starved to death is placed at 100,000. Other
kingdoms suffered heavily.</p>

<p>&para; In many of the provinces were laws to prevent immigration;
those who tried to get Bavarians to leave the country were
guilty of a crime, punishable by hanging. A similar punishment
was exacted for marrying out of one&#8217;s native province.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Also, the wretched condition of the roads added to the isolation
of the various German provinces. Exacting customs&#8217;
duties, military espionages, a weak postal system, contributed
to keep Germans unacquainted, except with near
neighbors. He, indeed, was a bold man who had gone over
the mountains or beyond his native valley. Even a journey
of two days caused grave anxieties; the carriage was almost
certain to be overturned in some deep rut and the travelers
injured or killed; robbers lay in wait in the mountains; protection
was almost unheard of; life and property were insecure;
every traveler had to be his own policeman, and never
issued forth on a journey without dagger, pistol and sword.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Thus, 300 princelings, great or small, were determined to
rule in their individual capacities; there was no Germany
in fact, and that much of the German Empire that had outlived
the gradual ruin of the old Holy Roman Empire, the
great-ancestor of Germany, was now approaching complete
dissolution.</p>

<p>The power lay no more in states, but in 300-odd local political
bureaus, scattered everywhere, dominated often enough
by an ambitious French prostitute, or by some lucky ballet-master.</p>

<p>&para; Then, there was August of Saxony, who is said to have
been the father of 300 children. This foolish fellow&#8217;s fetes
cost thalers by the wagon-load; one set of Chinese porcelains
ran into the millions, and it cost 6,000 thalers to gild
the gondolas for a night in June, to say nothing of the fancy
ball.</p>

<p>&para; The Baden monarch, Charles William, built Carlsruhe in the
deep forest, the better that his orgies be kept from prying
eyes.</p>

<p>&para; Eberhardt of Wuertemberg gave the whole conduct of his
government over to women and Jews&mdash;and by the way the
Jews were the only saving force. As for the Graevenitz
woman, she was king in petticoats. She mortgaged crown
lands and raised hell generally. One day in church she made
a fuss about not being mentioned among royal rulers, and
the pastor immediately replied: &#8220;Madam, we mention you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
daily in our prayers when we say: &#8216;O Lord, deliver us from
all evil!&#8217;&#8221; Once, in time of famine, Charles William scattered
loaves of bread; the rabble maddened by hunger fought
to the death for the dole!</p>

<p>&para; Also, there were Ernest of Hanover and Tony of Brunswick,
two precious rascals, with all their retinue of mistresses,
mistresses&#8217; maids, mothers, hangers-on, and pimps.
Carl Magnus had his Grehweiler palace costing 180,000 guelden.
He grew so desperate that the Emperor sent him to a
fortress for ten years&#8217; imprisonment, for forging documents
to raise the wind. Count Limburg-Styrum was a princeling
whose army consisted of one colonel, six officers and two
privates! Count William of Bueckeburg had a fort with 300
guns, defending a cabbage patch. Count Frederick of Salm-Kyrburg
swindled the churches; and in tiny Schwarzburg-Sondershausen,
only 15 miles square, was a royal palace of
350 rooms with clocks of all sizes, great and small, in each
apartment. This count went mad over clocks, but was popular
with the working class; often he would take a man off a
job in order to laugh and joke.</p>

<p>Also, Frederick had original taste in military affairs; his
army comprised 150 soldiers, with 28 guards on horseback.
The prince prided himself on being a wrestler, and one day
when a yokel threw the prince, the prince set up a great cry,
&#8220;I slipped on a cherry stone!&#8221;&mdash;and this regardless of the
fact that it was not the time of the year for cherries.</p>

<p>&para; There was another local ruler, Ludwig Guenther, who was
fond of painting horses, and on his death 246-odd horse pictures
adorned the walls of his palace.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; &#8220;Show a German a door and tell him to go through, and
he will try to break a hole in the wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Here, every one lives apart in his own narrow corner, with
his own opinions; his wife and children round him; ever suspicious
of the Government, as of his neighbor; judging everything
from his personal point of view, and never from general
grounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;The sentiment of individualism and the necessity for contradiction
are developed to an inconceivable degree in the
German.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The problem of directing this intense individualism is the
problem of German unity.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; With rough manners, blunders, extravagances, absurdities,
the hereditary princes continued to sponge on the peasants,
generation after generation, till wretchedness spread
far over the German lands. They had their ch&acirc;teaux, their
dancing girls, their dogs, horses, cats, mistresses and their
royal armies.</p>

<p>&para; The misery of centuries of oppression existed; petty monarchs
exercised powers of life and death.</p>

<p>&para; The South German mocked the North German&#8217;s pronunciation.
One set vowed that the &#8220;g&#8221; in &#8220;goose&#8221; is hard,
the other proclaimed that the &#8220;g&#8221; is soft. One side went
about mumbling with hard &#8220;g&#8217;s,&#8221; &#8220;A well-baked goose is a
gracious gift of God,&#8221; whereupon the other side replied that
all the &#8220;g&#8217;s&#8221; are &#8220;j&#8217;s,&#8221; that the &#8220;gute ganz&#8221; is really
&#8220;jute janz,&#8221; and &#8220;Gottes&#8221; &#8220;Jottes.&#8221; And duels were fought
over it.</p>

<p>&para; Nor was this all. An intense local pride expressed itself in
grotesque dialects, unsoftened by intercourse with the outer
world; also, there were outlandish fashions in dress and other
domestic affairs.</p>

<p>&para; In Brunswick the women wore green aprons, curious black
caps, the men buff coats, red vests with four rows of buttons,
caps with crazy pompons, buckled slippers and gay ribbon
garters.</p>

<p>&para; In lower Saxony the women wore flat straw hats, like a
dinner plate, hair plastered down, head-dresses of gigantic
black ribbons, aprons of gay stripes, and ten petticoats coming
only a little below the knee. The men wore farce-comedy
costumes, not unlike coachmen.</p>

<p>&para; In Pomerania-Rugen the women admired scarlet petticoats,
knee-length, capes like turko-rugs, black veils, green garters
and blue stockings. The men wore aprons like butchers, caps
and long-tailed coats.</p>

<p>&para; The Hessian women preferred turbans of red, vestees of
gay stuffs, blue, green or yellow knee-length skirts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p><hr />

<p>&para; The Baden men folk liked reds, greens and yellows, vests
adorned with many ribbons, top boots, high white collars and
funny-looking black coats. The women had their green
aprons, puffed sleeves, and ten short petticoats.</p>

<p>&para; In East Prussia men wore double and triple vests. As for
the women, they looked like animals in the zoo.</p>

<p>&para; In Wuertemberg, a typical landlord wore a blue peajacket
with two rows of large silver buttons, two vests of high contrasting
colors, a black sash, salmon-colored trousers, polished
boots;&mdash;and carried a meerschaum pipe.</p>

<p>&para; In Bavaria one saw green vests, yodlers&#8217; hats with tiny
feathers, green leggings, or military boots; and among the
women gay vestees, bright shawls and white kerchiefs.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Thus, the dead-weight of centuries still lay like a mountain
on the various German states.</p>

<p>&para; This dead-weight of olden times kept the German states
bickering among themselves.</p>

<p>For long years past, the people were divided by political
brawls, altercations, affrays, squabbles, feuds, often with the
loss of life. The general disposition was choleric, pugnacious,
litigious.</p>

<p>There was bad blood over principles and procedure, policies
and plans.</p>

<p>To transform aloofness to neighborliness, tumult to conciliation,
quarreling to friendliness, hostility to good will, dissent
must give way to assent, distrust to faith, denial to
admission, misgiving to conviction, political atheism to political
revelation.</p>

<p>Such are some of the peculiarities of the human animal; and
in political life human animals are prone to fight for self-interest,
like dogs over a bone.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We are not going to try to tell you of the many efforts by
rash reformers, in the half-century of the dead-weight, leading
to the rise of Prussia.</p>

<p>Again and again, far-sighted Germans, sick unto death at
the way things were going, urged equality for all men before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the law, equal taxation, restriction of the power of the
nobles.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, the peasants themselves stood in
the way. They did not care to change their condition, miserable
as it was. They dreaded the future, preferred present
miseries than to risk new ills. For example, on one occasion,
a certain political idealist excited the peasants in revolt,
assassinated 120 nobles, destroyed 264 castles. This was in
the time of Joseph II, of Austria, the ruler filled with amazing
ideas of equality. The peasants themselves were the
first to protest, much as they detested the nobles; and the
unsupported leaders died on the wheel, while 150 miserable
followers were buried alive.</p>

<p>And yet, at that very moment, the idealistic Joseph, who
with an excess of zeal, tried for political equality, made
enemies of his nobles, enemies of his peasants, likewise. The
great reformer was held a fanatic, intent on destroying
government. Too far ahead of his time, his plans for political
semi-equality failed.</p>

<p>&para; This monarch, thinking to make a lesson, had swindling
nobles placed in the stocks, like common thieves.</p>

<p>Joseph was one of the first great democrats, in the modern
sense. To him, the cause of the common man was sacred.
He believed in genuine equality, but alas, he did not know
how to bring about the political Millennium.</p>

<p>&para; He threw open the parks to the people; he proclaimed
free speech and free thought; he abolished serfdom; he
labored to construct a state-machine with one system of
justice and one National plan.</p>

<p>Joseph, though overbrimming with emotions for the common
man&#8217;s political salvation, failed to allow for the ignorance
of his people, their stubborn avowal of local self-interests.</p>

<p>&para; And it fell out that his people thought that Joseph was
trying to enslave them the more; ingratitude and misapprehensions
followed, destroying the liberal reformer&#8217;s most
cherished plans for his beloved Austria-Germany.</p>

<p>The word was passed alone that Joseph was a tyrant. You
see, as frequently happens, the people preferred old abuses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to new ways. The general population hugged their chains
and refused to be delivered.</p>

<p>This singular belief in the past, rather than in the future, is
indeed a human weakness and has checked and restrained
the rise of intellectual freedom since the world began.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It might all have been a good lesson to republicans, but
the nobility assumed a threatening attitude and the peasants
did not understand a monarch like Joseph.</p>

<p>Their idea of a king was a man going upstairs on horseback
and eating spiders. A king must have powers of life and
death and bags of gold. A citizen king was absurd.</p>

<p>The peasantry, on whom Joseph had endeavored to bestow
many large democratic privileges, rose against him. He died
Feb. 20, 1790, &#8220;a century too early,&#8221; says Jellenz, and as
Remer adds, &#8220;misunderstood by a people unworthy of such a
sovereign.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Germany, in the sad period between 1750 and 1806 had
long been a European political jest; these are hard words,
but it is the language of truth.</p>

<p>She had sunk so low that she saw no degradation in going
off to fight French or British wars, while at home remaining
a mere political nonentity.</p>

<p>She had sunk so low, under French influences, and through
her own lack of self-control, that she forgot her great ancestors
and her noble traditions.</p>

<p>She had sunk so low that her very children were brought up
to despise the language of the Fatherland; the children scoffing
at the parents, aped foreign ways rather than support
German originality, strength and national genius; young men
coming of age preferred to leave the land of their birth,
mocked the simple German virtues, and occupied themselves
in idle dalliance in Paris, or failing in this, set up imitations
of French courts in the petty German monarchies.</p>

<p>Thus, finally Germany became insensible, indifferent and debased
by stupid and selfish ideals from beyond the Vosges;
till at last Germany became, literally, a land without a people,
a people without a land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Worse still, the time came when, under these false teachings,
a sense of shame no longer lived, to arouse great national
interests and to recall degenerate sons to their solemn
duties to their Fatherland.</p>

<p>Hundreds of noble Germans, at one time or another, during
these dark years, tried in vain by voice or pen to restore national
consciousness, but failed. The problem of German
liberty seemed incapable of solution; and as for the still
larger problem of German unity&mdash;that became a mere dream.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We glorify here and now, the genius and the manhood of
Bismarck as the one man who had the strength of purpose
to recall to Germans the heroic tale of a free and united
Fatherland.</p>

<p>It took him thirty years or more, through well-nigh superhuman
striving; he preached, he cursed, he vilified, he used
the iron rod.</p>

<p>He would have absolutely nothing to do with the political
ideas from over the Vosges; he knew too well the curse of
olden times, and his one great central emotion was to end
that condition&mdash;as he hoped forever.</p>

<p>You are to read of the battles of a giant, filled with immense
compassion for the follies and weaknesses of his misled
countrymen, filled, too, with fanatical zeal to punish, that
good might come of it at last.</p>

<p>Bismarck used the strong military arm, the hell fires and the
lightnings.</p>

<p>His nature scorned any further mere palliation of the weaknesses
of human nature. Like all supermen, Bismarck struck
straight from the shoulder; in turn to be misunderstood,
cursed and reviled by the very people he would serve; but
in the end aroused German manhood to a just comprehension
of the power and dignity of a free and united Fatherland.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; For upwards of 100 years before Bismarck&#8217;s great hour,
the French had been accustomed to exploit Germany. To fill
the pocketbook, to provide soldiers for wars, or to afford opportunities
for buccaneering expeditions, were all the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not say this to bring up any &#8220;moral&#8221; issue, but we
make the statement merely as one uses the word dung or
manure.</p>

<p>That is to say, certain historical facts stink to heaven.</p>

<p>Annexations, concessions, raids, riots at the hands of the
French conspired to keep Germany disunited, belligerent and
mutinous; and as the years passed Germany, to a large extent,
seduced by French ways, lost a sense of her dignity.
France had looked to Germany to furnish allies to help fight
Prussia, Austria or England; then England turned the trick
against France. It is discouraging to add that even the
great Goethe was so seduced by the glamour of Napoleon&#8217;s
genius that he wrote these strange words in praise of the
French tyrant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Doubts that have baffled thousands, he has solved:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ideas o&#8217;er which centuries have brooded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His giant mind intuitively compressed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&para; Thus, you have before you this spectacle: Germany&#8217;s greatest
poetical genius forgets the sad reality of his broken,
dispirited and disrupted country and leaves her to her
wretched fate; passing his time as a sentimental voluptuary
in the splendor of the Weimar court, where he concerns himself
with such works as &#8220;Elective Affinities,&#8221; a frank endorsement
of adultery.</p>

<p>&para; On the other side, the noble Schiller, poet of the people, recalled
to his fellow countrymen the faded glory of Germany.
&#8220;Schiller stands forth,&#8221; says Menzel, &#8220;as the champion of
liberty, justice and his country.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a word, it took Germany 100 years to learn by suffering
that if she is ever to regain her fallen prestige as a nation,
she must fight her enemies at home and abroad; she must
restore the military ideal of ancient times. And here, in a
nutshell, is the very root of all this cry about militarism:
The man who will not fight for what he regards as his political
rights, remains a slave his whole life long; for it is the
essential nature of man to exercise tyrannous power over
human lives, whenever such practice holds out promise of
advantage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, Bismarck again trained Germany to be a fighting
nation; and if an ideal of a free and united people is no justification,
then words have no meaning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The French peasant&#8217;s son, returning from the wars
brings his wife a diamond necklace.</p></div>

<p>&para; The cross-angles of politics, for years, lead as far as one
cares to go, in this German family fight. Each petty state
has its intrigues and its grievances; you become befuddled;
it is all weariness of the flesh.</p>

<p>&para; However, behind all the political jargon, mighty forces are
taking form; and little by little, certain outstanding facts
come to view, involving every king, knight, bishop, prince
and pauper on the German map, from the North Sea to the
Black Sea.</p>

<p>After 1789, the German was down with that new disease,
French constitutionalism; liberty, fraternity and equality.
No human being knew exactly what it meant. It was a
political fever that had to be gone through with; and blood-letting
was the only cure.</p>

<p>Monarchs seemingly secure on their thrones from the days
of old, now shivered like ghosts as the mobs marched the
streets of Vienna and Berlin, waiving new flags and crying
&#8220;Liberty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The word &#8220;liberty&#8221; went to the crook-backed German peasant&#8217;s
brain like wine; he grew mad with the idea of an impossible
world, in which he could decree as he desired and
all would bow to him, though he in return would bow to
nobody; in short, liberty for him, but death to the others;
and were it possible to confiscate the property of the princes
and redistribute the loot among the peasants, so much the
better.</p>

<p>&para; Before we go into this thing, let us remember that as
the French armies marched over Europe, the doom of kings
had been cracking and rumbling.</p>

<p>The soldiers carried everywhere the idea of French equality,
that is to say, to the popular mind an opportunity to share<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the loot. Napoleon himself, reflecting on his own career and
on the follies of the French revolution, said: &#8220;Let us now
turn ourselves to something practical; the bombastic ideas of
the Revolution have exhausted themselves in grotesque efforts
at self-government. All the Revolution means is an
opportunity for a man of talents to show what he can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; And the French soldiers, returning from the wars, brought
their wives and daughters gold rings, bracelets and diamond
necklaces, the loot of the capitals of Europe.</p>

<p>&para; As for Napoleon, he, of course, took the lion&#8217;s share; but a
diamond necklace to a soldier&#8217;s wife is indeed a powerful
argument on the importance of the new democratic era, in
which peasants&#8217; sons wear gold lace and their womankind
ride in carriages.</p>

<p>Also, many of the generals of France were sons of peasants;
and an account of Napoleon&#8217;s marshals would show the
humble origin of men of the hour, sons of soap boilers, tavern
keepers, stable-bosses.</p>

<p>&para; One may imagine the result of such surprising overturnings
of caste, in old-world conditions. Henceforth the peasants
of all lands will naturally regard their respective kings
as so many dogs, to be shot to death at the first splendid
opportunity! And Germany is no exception.</p>

<p>&para; Forward march, ye sons of the soil, there are stormy days
ahead for you, through your &#8220;new&#8221; ideas.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Humiliations heaped upon her by France; the
strange combination, the lash and the kiss!</p></div>

<p>&para; First, let us quote from Bismarck, who looking backward
after his amazing politico-military triumph at Koeniggraetz,
(1866), tells a French interviewer for &#8220;Le Siecle&#8221; this root-fact
about Germans, their weakness and their power:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;No government, however it may act, will be popular in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Prussia; the majority in the country will always be opposed
to it; simply from its being the Government;&mdash;and holding
authority over the individual, the central authority is always
doomed to be constantly opposed by the moderates, and decried
and despised by the ultras. This has been the common
fate of all successive governments since the beginning of the
dynasty. Neither liberal ministers, nor reactionary ministers
have found favor with our Prussian politicians.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Frederick William III, surnamed the Just, had succeeded
as little as Frederick William IV in satisfying the Prussian
nation.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;They shouted themselves hoarse at the victories of Frederick
the Great, but at his death they rubbed their hands at
the thought of being delivered from the tyrant! Despite this
antagonism, there exists a deep attachment to the royal
house. No sovereign or minister, no government, can win
the favor of Prussian individualism. Yet all cry from the
depths of their hearts, &#8216;God save the King!&#8217; And they obey
when the King commands.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; With this clue from the master before us, the thing to do
is, clearly, to reach out after this German Unity idea in a
broad way.</p>

<p>&para; Napoleon&#8217;s armies had marched everywhere, during all
those victorious years, and each soldier had been a living
exemplar of the power of National glory.</p>

<p>This National spirit in his armies had helped Napoleon amazingly,
despite his genius as a soldier. The great Prussian
patriot, Stein, one of the leading men of his time and an
early believer in the high destiny of his country, began studying
some of the more obscure but vital forces behind Napoleon&#8217;s
career of glory. Stein finally read the secret and
urged that as Napoleon had won by National spirit, so Napoleon
could in the end be defeated by a similar National
spirit when properly opposed to him; and Napoleon with one
terrifying black look saw that von Stein had divined the
real force of French solidarity, a proclamation was out for
von Stein&#8217;s head, and the patriot who dreamed of his Confederation
of Germany, against the French, or any other foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
foe, was obliged to make his escape to the heart of the
Bohemian mountains.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Fr: Wm. II (1797-1840), child of the Revolution, to his
dying day remained untouched by the new political principles
that had their origin beyond the Rhine. Compound of dreams
and realities, William had led a repressed life; for one thing,
he did not fight for his opinions; indeed his opinions were
literary and artistic; a peculiar pietism bound him; he believed
too much in man&#8217;s natural goodness; being an honest
man himself, he did not readily suspect others.</p>

<p>&para; This Frederick was always thinking of a Germany built on
the traditional order, with all intervening social grades, from
peasant to king upon his throne, each bowing and scraping
to the other; and Frederick, as the father of his kingdom, exercising
a despotic paternalism.</p>

<p>&para; Nor did he see that the French revolution had been fought
and Napoleon&#8217;s armies had carried afar if not the seeds of
political equality, at least the glorious conception that &#8220;revolution
means opportunity for men of talents, everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The pressure on the king was found in this: that under
duress he had promised a written constitution.</p>

<p>&para; And behold Frederick in these troublous times! For eleven
long years, off and on, he tries to find a common ground of
religious formulas for the united Lutheran and Reformed
churches. He even attacks Rome on the question of mixed
marriages. Of course, he failed utterly, this noble-minded
Hohenzollern who believed too implicitly in the inherent
goodness of mankind.</p>

<p>&para; Repair then to your church windows and read your blackletter
Bible, you dreaming Frederick; such is your story, in
a few words.</p>

<p>Gabble about your Gothic restorations as you will, and your
correct revisions of the liturgy, Frederick, it remains for
your Louise to do a man&#8217;s work against French foes, and
thus hasten the slow-coming of United Germany.</p>

mailed fist. Everything is going to rack and ruin; beloved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Prussia repeatedly humiliated by French invaders; and had
it not been for noble Queen Louise there might well be no
Prussian glory at this hour to record.</p>

for us through the art of Joseph Grassi; and is to be
seen in the Hohenzollern Museum.</p>

<p>The artist depicts her with youthful charm, her fair brow
adorned by her slender crown, whose weight, alas, although
slight, gave her no rest till death.</p>

<p>Her eyes are gentle, and about her face and form is the indefinable
touch of ever-present girlishness, never to fade,
even in the woman-grown.</p>

<p>&para; It were nearer the truth to say Louise personifies Prussia&#8217;s
ambition to power.</p>

<p>&para; This beautiful woman bore indeed a heavy burden; well she
knew the dread and fear of kings and kingly office.</p>

<p>&para; On the one side was the tyrant Napoleon, on the other Fr:
Wilhelm, her kingly husband, without an idea outside of
cathedral architecture and bishoprics in Jerusalem; yet
Louise willed that Prussia should seize the reins of power,
shake off the French yoke, and mount the heights of glory.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; As a foil to the ferocious Bismarck&mdash;himself a majestic
king-maker&mdash;here we reveal to you a true creator of National
honor, in the form of a frail, fair woman; showing thus how
far the pendulum of Time and Chance often rocks in bringing
about political changes.</p>

<p>Though poles apart, the brutal Bismarck stands side by side
with the lovely Louise; the blood and iron of the man were
of no avail without the finesse of the woman.</p>

<p>Thus this singular cross-fertilization, compounded of smiles
and frowns&mdash;the kiss and the lash&mdash;the white jeweled hand
and the mailed fist in the end makes it possible for humiliated
Prussia to rise again&mdash;the late harvest of the years
bringing the reality of our United Germany.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s amazing story we spread before you in detail,
but beside that frowning rock we stoop for a moment to
pluck the modest violets clinging all unobserved in a gloomy
place where the sun seldom comes; these flowers are Louise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and their subtle perfume symbolizes the penetrating yet delicate
incense of her pathetic life.</p>

<p>&para; Without Louise, our story were soon ended. Otherwise Bismarck
himself could not have come into the illustrious pages
of history. Noble Prussian queen, heroine of Prussian glory,
mother-consoler in the twilight, your gentle spirit hovers like
some evening-star, luminous with hope.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Napoleon&#8217;s hated Continental system of domination
causes Prussian downfall&mdash;The Queen decides to
fight back.</p></div>

<p>&para; The treaty of Luneville, February, 1801, now seemed to
lend color to Napoleon&#8217;s greatest delusion of grandeur; he
would restore the ancient domain of Charlemagne, comprising
France, Germany and Italy! Signing with Prussia and
Bavaria, Napoleon confiscated broad Papal domains along
the Rhine, lands that had been in possession of the church
since Roman times. With this bribe for secular princes, as
the price of the readjustment, exactly 112 Teutonic domains,
petty in size but all-powerful with the prestige of centuries,
vanished from the map. The holy Electors of Treves and
Cologne, those empire-makers of ancient days, were stripped
of their worldly possessions, and expelled from the Papal
lands.</p>

<p>&para; There were even rumors of a French-supported Emperor of
Prussia&mdash;think of that!</p>

<p>Francis of Austria, for reasons of policy, gave up the high-swelling
title, &#8220;Holy Roman Emperor,&#8221; and more modestly
contented himself with &#8220;Emperor of Austria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; And now, when Napoleon&#8217;s delusion&mdash;Charlemagne&mdash;seemed
on the very point of realization, there came the third
Coalition against him; Prussia joined against France; but
Napoleon soon gained the most noted of his victories, Austerlitz;
15,000 prisoners, 12,000 dead on the field, represented
Austria&#8217;s loss alone, but this was not all.</p>

<p>The victorious French pressed on to Vienna. By the treaty
of Pressburg, Austria was excluded from Germany; Wuertemberg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Bavaria and the Rhinelands went over to the
French, Napoleon setting himself up as Protector of the
Rhine country, with his representative President Karl von
Dalberg, former archbishop of Mainz.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Louise was high-spirited, impulsive, courageous, imaginative&mdash;the
very foil of her slow-going Frederick, with his
church restorations forevermore. The Queen, always for
an aggressive policy, by her sympathy encouraged the Prussian
war party; patriots, restive under the indecision of
Frederick, were eager to shake off French domination. The
appeal was to Militarism, but what would you? The Hun
was not only &#8220;at the gate,&#8221; but was inside the walls; and if
a man will not fight for his fireside, then he must remain a
slave. It was a virtuous cause.</p>

<p>&para; The cabal at the Prussian court, secretly in opposition to
the easy-going King, was aided by Louise. There were the
King&#8217;s brothers, the ambitious Hardenburg, the King&#8217;s cousin,
Ferdinand, the gifted Rahel Levin&mdash;and many others.</p>

<p>These plots within the palace gave to Louise&#8217;s life strange
political aspects.</p>

<p>&para; The Queen desired to strike.</p>

<p>&para; By 1805 Austria, Russia and Great Britain were united,
but Russia still wavered.</p>

<p>&para; Louise&#8217;s secret influence became a watchword for Prussian
patriots, who despised French rule.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; After Austerlitz, Napoleon read Prussia his ultimatum:
Shall it be war or peace? Peace and Hanover, or war with
me?</p>

<p>&para; A treaty was drawn giving to Napoleon control over Prussia;
and this document Fr: William weakly signed. After
that Napoleon simply ignored Prussia; made it so hot for
Prussian ministers that they resigned when Paris frowned,
or danced when Paris smiled. Napoleon set up his new
Rhein Confederation without consulting Prussia; and Prussian
patriots felt themselves mortified beyond endurance.</p>

<p>&para; Young men in Berlin, by way of protest, made a demonstration.
Going to the doorsteps of the French minister,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
they there sharpened their swords! Napoleon was furious;
he sought out the bookseller circulating an anti-French
pamphlet, &#8220;The Deepest Humiliation of Prussia,&#8221; lured him
across the frontier, and had him assassinated.</p>

<p>&para; The Prussian patriotic party, begun as a court cabal secretly
headed by Louise, decided on war.</p>

<p>&para; The troops were drilled night and day in preparation for
the great war of liberation. Never before had a downtrodden
nation worked harder to win liberty through liberation
from the French yoke. However, the immediate results were
to be disastrous.</p>

<p>&para; The Queen&#8217;s dragoons went to the front; the Queen rode
near by in her carriage; she wore a smart military coat,
colors of her crack regiment; and General Kalkreuth, in a
burst of enthusiasm, vowed that the Queen could herself
win the war should she remain with the troops.</p>

<p>&para; Yes, Louise was actually going out to fight Napoleon&#8217;s
veterans, Napoleon&#8217;s famous marshals, Berthier, Murat and
the others; and even the great Napoleon himself.</p>

<p>The decisive struggle took place at Jena, October 16, 1806;
Prussian forces were annihilated.</p>

<p>&para; Napoleon came on to Berlin and housed himself in the
Prussian palace. From here he now issued bulletins denouncing
Louise as the cause of the war; he attacked her
character, accusing her of a liaison with the handsome Alexander
of Russia, and of still other intrigues with high army
officers; he presented her as a compound of shameless camp-follower
and dangerous woman, plotting against her own
husband, thus bringing ruin to her native land.</p>

<p>Napoleon even had Louise&#8217;s apartments broken into and the
Queen&#8217;s papers seized, to see if incriminating evidence could
not be uncovered. Ah, he knew all the tricks of love as well
as of war!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; But Napoleon went too far. His cruel persecution caused
Prussians to sympathize with their Queen, instead of reviling
her.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Years before the great question is settled Prussia
indeed becomes Germany&mdash;in moody thoughtfulness&mdash;in
stubborn determination&mdash;in unflinching
courage.</p></div>

<p>&para; Louise now reveals herself a glorious National heroine. In
spite of her animosity toward Napoleon for his atrocious
slanders, the Queen decided to arrange an interview with
the conqueror and beg favorable terms for her beloved
Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; The meeting took place July 6, 1807. Napoleon sent his
coach, drawn by six white horses, to bring the Queen to
the miller&#8217;s house, where the interview was staged in an
upper room. Louise had on her finest court robe, white crepe
embroidered with silver, and wore her famous crown of
pearls; her loveliness and her woman&#8217;s wit were to be used
in behalf of prostrate Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; Napoleon rode up in great style, surrounded by his brilliant
staff&mdash;Berthier, Murat and the others. Louise awaited
him at the head of the rickety stairs. As he went up in the
semi-darkness, he stumbled and fell.</p>

<p>The Queen apologized that she was forced to meet the Emperor
in so mean a place; but he immediately replied that
to see so lovely a woman was well worth a few minor obstacles.</p>

<p>&para; Louise now began pleading with Napoleon for leniency
toward Prussia. What an interview that was!</p>

<p>How eloquently she set forth her people&#8217;s sufferings in the
great French wars; she pictured the sorrows of Prussia so
vividly that at last Napoleon became mightily interested.
Finally he said:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Ah, your Majesty asks very much indeed, but I am dreaming!&#8221;
By this he meant, &#8220;I do not hear a word you say; I
am looking at your beautiful eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The clever Louise saw that she was progressing with her
arguments, and undoubtedly had the Emperor under the
spell of her fatal beauty; to oblige a grand lady in distress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
he would be willing to concede much indeed, in his famous
r&ocirc;le of lady-killer and protector of feminine loveliness.</p>

<p>But at that precise moment, who should enter the room but
Fr: Wilhelm himself, the Queen&#8217;s blundering husband!</p>

<p>&para; Always in the way&mdash;mentally clumsy&mdash;he spoiled everything!
The interview ended abruptly.</p>

<p>&para; Louise, heartbroken, retired in utter despair. She had believed
that the justice of her cause, her eloquence, her loyalty
to her people would go far to soften Napoleon&#8217;s wrath, but
in all this she was cruelly disappointed. Next day the French
tyrant announced his terms: Indemnity of 154,000,000 marks;
one-third cash; one-third payable in lands; the final third
&#8220;on time,&#8221; in the interim he would garrison in five fortified
towns 30,000 French troops and 10,000 French cavalry,
whose support was at the expense of Prussia, till the debt
was paid.</p>

<p>&para; This great Queen, after life&#8217;s fever, sleeps enshrined in
her snowy marble tomb at Charlottenburg.</p>

<p>One day you will stand with uncovered head beside her royal
grave, and recall her noble life. She deserves well of her
country!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; But mark this well: out of Prussia&#8217;s humiliations came
her ultimate strength; the vanquished, as is often the story
of human life, was strengthened more than the victors.
Prussia, chastened by her severe lessons, henceforth proceeded
to build herself up slowly till at last she was ready,
many, many years later, to strike for German Unity that
final blow at the palace of the French kings at Versailles.</p>

<p>&para; In the wearisome stretch of time till that distant day of
German glory, Prussia henceforth becomes Germany&mdash;in
spirit&mdash;in moody thoughtfulness&mdash;in stubborn determination&mdash;yes,
under God, by blood and iron! There float before us
many noble names, poets, prophets, soldiers who aid in
stimulating &#8220;German national faith&#8221;&mdash;Fichte, Arndt, Kleist,
Roon, Moltke, Scharnhorst, Humboldt&mdash;and in the historical
twilight big with mutterings and rumblings of the New
Time to come with all its glory, taking the place of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Prussian ruin between 1806 and 1813, is Queen Louise, her
gentle spirit a veritable evening-star, luminous with hope.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; By 1813, Fr: William III had been induced by the pressure
of public opinion to join Russia to fight off the French. May
17, 1813, William&#8217;s famous decree, &#8220;To My People!&#8221; called
for help to expel invaders, thereby to recover Prussian independence;
and Napoleon was totally defeated in the tremendous
battle of Leipzig, October 16-19, or &#8220;Battle of the Nations,&#8221;
as the Germans call Prussia&#8217;s return to power and
glory.</p>

<p>&para; It was this patriotic appeal &#8220;To My People,&#8221; that made
William&#8217;s troubles; the Prussian Liberals felt that the Government
owed the people a Liberal political Constitution, in
return for Leipzig.</p>

<p>&para; His Majesty grabbed on it, twice, and was at his wit&#8217;s end
to know how to keep his crown and his declaration of friendship
for the people.</p>

<p>In the meantime, twenty-three minor German states having
adopted constitutions, more or less liberal, the growing demands
of the common people for a share in Prussian government
could be no longer denied.</p>



<h5><a name="s19" id="s19"></a>19</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Kingcraft comes upon evil days&mdash;in the rising tide
of liberal ideas, monarchies of old are all but swept
away.</p></div>

<p>&para; When the Napoleonic dynasty collapsed, after Waterloo,
there were 39 petty principalities in the German-speaking
area grouped about Rhein, the Main, Neckar, Elbe; these
knights&#8217; holdings, ecclesiastical strongholds, and domains of
various descriptions became merged by cross-fighting
throughout the Napoleonic era.</p>

<p>&para; The Congress of Vienna (1815) deeming it advisable to
set up a loose confederacy of the multitude of petty powers,
founded a German Confederation, but whether it was geographical,
racial or political no human being could say.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The local German princes kept full sovereign powers, but
gradually, as a matter of expediency, the various states
grouped themselves around Prussia and Austria. As for the
Nation, there was no German sovereign, no supreme court,
no commercial or political relationship worthy of the name.
Instead, on every hand was intense local hatred, aloofness
and suspicion. This condition continued for very many years.</p>

<p>&para; The plain fact was that the various princes did not want
German National unity; for the reason that it is not human
nature for men to give up an advantage for an uncertainty.
Also, at this time, neither Prussia nor Austria was strong
enough to impose her hegemony upon Germany. Austria&#8217;s
policy was for delay; and in Prussia the general belief existed
for many years that Austrian domination was really
essential to put down the rising spirit of Democracy.</p>

<p>&para; The authority of the Congress set up a Bond of Confederation,
ruled by a Diet or Bundestag, sitting at Frankfort-on-the-Main.</p>

<p>&para; In the hurly-burly, certain centres, such as Saxony, Bavaria
and Wuertemberg, were raised in rank from duchies to
kingdoms, while still others, such as Westphalia, Grand
Duchy of Warsaw, were dissolved. The free cities were reduced
to four; caste declined in political importance. The
Confederation of the Rhine was set aside.</p>

<p>Thus the close of the Napoleonic period found German territory
without political unity.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The last stand of kingly ultra-conservatism is the one
great political feature of Europe, from the downfall of Napoleon,
1815, to the popular outbreaks of 1848. During this
dark period the cause of constitutional liberty in Prussia
made little progress. Old forms as well as new were under
suspicion. On the one side were ultra-conservative conceptions
of Divine-right, upheld by Metternich, and on the
other side was the idea that sovereignty came not from
heaven but from earth, making the will of the people the
voice of God.</p>

<p>&para; Prussia and Austria, as the representatives of Divine-right,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
closely watched these revolutionary tendencies, suppressed
uprisings, muzzled the press, in an attempt to check the
surging tide of liberalism.</p>

<p>However much the kings had feared the wars of Napoleon,
kingcraft was now confronted by an enemy more deadly.
The babble of the bondsmen about to break their chains
portended far greater disaster to dynasties than ever did bullets
on the battlefield of Waterloo.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; With might and main, the monarchs, resisting the demands
of the people for constitutional government, stamped out
everything that looked like the first signs of National sentiment.</p>

<p>&para; Nor was Germany alone in this reactionary attitude. The
kingly side of all Europe stood shoulder to shoulder against
new political experiments.</p>

<p>In Italy, Greece, Spain, sovereigns applied the lash the
harder, in an endeavor to suppress this new evil against
kingcraft; nevertheless, among the common people there continued
to grow consciousness of political rights.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Napoleon in many of the lands he conquered,&#8221; says Ffyfe,
&#8220;set up many revolutionary ideas that sounded the death
knell of the Feudal system. It was part of his administrative
genius to take the lands from barons and their class,
and turn them over to peasants; it happened in France with
the lands of the ecclesiastical barons of the church; it happened
in North Germany, in 1810, when the decree of administrative
following the annexation of the North German
Coast swept away with a few strokes of the pen, thirty-six
forms of Feudal privileges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; And these could never be restored, even after the Congress
of Vienna spent seven or eight months, after Waterloo, dividing
the loot among the old royal houses.</p>

<p>&para; The system of monarchical Absolutism maintained itself in
one way or another for years, but the old-line conception of
the political legitimacy of despotic rulers had been rudely
shattered.</p>

<p>&para; In spite of a brave show of gold cloth, diamonds, laces,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
jewels, swords, silk stockings, lackeys, grooms, guards and
crowns, kingcraft was now placed on the defensive. The
cry of the people, &#8220;Liberty!&#8221; filled many a market-place.</p>

<p>&para; Forces of democracy were working everywhere, ill-directed
to be sure, but never despairing of ultimate victory over
kingcraft, which indeed had now come upon evil days. It is
an undeniable fact that Bonaparte had purged the political
ideas of French Revolution of many excesses, and had turned
to practical account certain forms of liberty, for example,
ridding captured lands, as Ffyfe tells us, of offensive special
privileges, on part of irresponsible rulers of petty degree;
but the danger was found in this: that a mere &#8220;desire&#8221; for
political expediency, however surrounded by the halo of
popular rights, avails nothing unless ultimately sustained
by strong central authority; and it requires no profound
knowledge of men&#8217;s way to know that at no time in the history
of the world has collective rulership been other than a
theory. The excesses of the French Revolution were not
readily overlooked by the conservative elements in Germany.</p>



<h5><a name="s20" id="s20"></a>20</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>German hope of National Union gleams like a star.</p></div>

<p>&para; There gradually grew throughout Germany a spirit of intense
longing for country, and many a noble spirit had in
a vision seen from afar the common Fatherland. Especially
in the universities, the feeling was strong.</p>

<p>The German universities were hotbeds of political excitement.
For many years after Napoleon&#8217;s downfall all manner
of theories of government were strenuously debated,
to the accompaniment of duels, beer-drinking, private feuds,
and popular agitation, often ending in blood. The Burschenschaft,
as the student brothers were called, finally formed
themselves into a league comprising sixty schools; and held
a famous meeting at Wartburg, 1817.</p>

<p>&para; The patriots took Holy Communion, made impassioned
speeches, built bonfires and cast into the flames hated books
supporting Metternich&#8217;s system of kingcraft. Also the patriots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
consigned to the fire an illiberal pamphlet by King
Fr: Wilhelm III of Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; Metternich became alarmed. Kotzebue, hated as a spy of
Russia in Germany, was stabbed to the heart by Karl Sand.
This gave to Metternich the desired opportunity, and he
proceeded forthwith to impress on Fr: Wilhelm and the Czar
the absurdity of toying longer with &#8220;Democratic ideas and
paper constitutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then and there the Biblical phrases of democrat-mongering
kings, under the Holy Alliance, ceased in the high courts
of Russia and Prussia. Metternich got hold of Fr: Wilhelm,
also the other political tools of the Frankfort Diet, and at
Carlsbad decrees were issued sounding the doom of Liberalism
and the return to power of the old-line kings.</p>

<p>By gag-law and intimidation Metternich rushed the decrees
through the Diet;&mdash;and for a generation &#8220;Carlsbad&#8221; signified
the suppression of Democratic sentiments throughout
Germany.</p>

<p>&para; Metternich fought free speech, free parliaments and a
free press. His iron laws were aimed to stifle democratic
mutterings. Austrian spies were everywhere, searching out
revolutionary societies.</p>

<p>&para; The hope that Prussia might be the leader in the new
German spirit of nationality now vanished. William III
definitely withdrew his promise of a written Constitution,
made in 1813, and reiterated in 1815.</p>

<p>Persecutions continued north and south; Prussia hounded
Jahn for five long years, this Jahn whose gymnastic societies
had been so helpful in hardening young men to Prussian
army services; and the poet Arndt, whose impassioned
verse intensified the National spirit of Germany, was shamefully
treated, his papers scattered and the man driven from
his university.</p>

<p>&para; For many a long year the gloomy spirit of &#8220;Carlsbad&#8221; decrees
hung over Germany.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; However, the Germans have an intensely practical side as
well as a dreamy poetical side. It is not surprising, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that the earliest steps in the direction of German unity
(1818) came through Prussian customs house reforms under
the patriot, Maassen.</p>

<p>&para; There had been, as we explained heretofore, no freedom of
trade throughout Germany; each of the petty thirty-nine
states was surrounded by Chinese walls; for example, to
send goods from Hamburg to Vienna, the shipper had to pay
ten separate tolls.</p>

<p>&para; Under the old Prussian system there were in vogue at one
and the same time no less than sixty-seven conflicting tariff
systems. All this tax oppression meant a harvest for smugglers.
But Maassen, at a stroke, established a common tariff
in Prussia; made the tax so low that smuggling became unprofitable.
The other states protested vehemently at first,
but one by one entered this new customs union.</p>

<p>&para; And we may understand now certain sarcastic remarks
sometimes made about Germany by her historical enemies:
&#8220;Paper, cheese, sauerkraut, ham, and matches, served to
unite German hearts more than political ties!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; This slur is ill-deserved; at best, it simply means that the
advantages of the &#8220;Zollverein&#8221; were economic as well as
political; and, in later years, the necessity for a common
system of doing business played a deservedly important part
in helping along Bismarck&#8217;s plans.</p>

<p>&para; The customs league, called the &#8220;Zollverein,&#8221; is generally
held to be the very beginning of practical unity for Germany.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; On the poetical side of German character, earliest appeals
for the Fatherland&mdash;one and united!&mdash;were expressed down
through the years; long indeed before actual political union
was possible, Germany&#8217;s bards, in their impassioned, semi-religious
songs awakened in German hearts the spirit of intense
longing for the common Fatherland, based on blood-brotherhood
and language.</p>

<p>&para; One of the famous types of this patriot-poet was Arndt,
son of an emancipated slave. Arndt was a noble democrat;
his history of slavery in Pomerania inspired Adolphus to
abolish that evil, 1806; the Prussian aristocrats held Arndt a
life-long grudge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Spirit of the Times,&#8221; his patriotic trumpet-call aroused
Prussians to fight France. Napoleon tracked the lyric poet
out; Arndt fled to Sweden; but continued to write for the
cause. He returned to Germany, 1809.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?&#8221; remains one of the
great semi-religious songs of nations. Arndt asks what
comprises the Fatherland? Surely not Prussia, not Swabia,
nor this nor that, but all side by side comprise the German
brotherhood of race and language.</p>

Trompeten,&#8221; were on all patriotic lips; at this, William III,
mightily offended, had Arndt arrested and sent him into
retirement for twenty years.</p>

<p>&para; The old man lived to become a great National hero. He
died January 29, 1860, aged 91. It is pleasant to record that
on his ninetieth birthday Germany united in good wishes
for their national poet of the dark hours.</p>

<p>The people built him a monument at the place of his birth,
Schoritz, and another at Bonn, where for many years he
had been professor of history.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is not time, O William, to go to church but to
go to war; yet you and your son keep on reading
your Gothic Bible.</p></div>

<p>&para; Now comes the year 1840; William III goes to the tomb
of his ancestors, and is succeeded by Fr: William IV, with
whom began anew the long battle between the principle of
Divine-right of kings and political democracy exercised by
the masses. William IV, intensely addicted to Divine-right
theories of government, was in the course of a turbulent reign
forced to face great political agitators. However, the King
had behind his throne, always, that conservative class (found
in every country) that clings tenaciously to the past and
dreads the future. The watchword of all William&#8217;s enemies
was &#8220;Liberty!&#8221; The cry, visionary as it was, served as a
rallying point for those who favored some form of French
constitutionalism; and while, as a whole, the so-called friends
of Liberty were very impracticable, had no definite plan for
relief, we find among the political agitators foremost in their
discontent many of the brightest minds in Germany, college
graduates, professional men, the clergy, and solid middle
class merchants. All were zealous for immediate political
reforms.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Consider the position of our Fr: William IV. He was a
peculiar man, to begin with&mdash;and an irresolute man, to end
with. He was not built for times of war. Yet he had to face
cannon!</p>

<p>Early in life, in impressionable years, through a court blunder,
young William had had a tutor, Delbrueck, who poisoned
his charge&#8217;s mind against the Prussian military and bureaucratic
system.</p>

<p>The attitude of Delbrueck was certainly heresy as vile as
though your own child&#8217;s nurse should bring your boy up to
fear and despise his own father. Surely, you would not like
that?</p>

<p>&para; Delbrueck was quickly given the sack; and it was well that
he got off without a broken head!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He was succeeded by a preacher, Ancillon, of renown in
church affairs. This Ancillon started young William off on
another track; antiques, church history, Bible study, architecture,
the brotherhood of man, and the fatherhood of God.</p>

<p>&para; Then William studied art under Rausen, and under Schinkel;
and also the future king became absorbed in landscape
gardening and in architecture.</p>

<p>&para; William was presumed to be &#8220;liberal&#8221; in his views, that is
to say, he was, in a sense, supposed to be a &#8220;democrat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Of course, the Radicals at this hour knew nothing of Bismarck,
who was to be the power behind the throne. They
saw instead only a weak king; and history tells over and
over again, down through time, what becomes of weak kings
when the people are throwing up barricades in the streets
and are tossing up their caps and crying &#8220;Liberty!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Under his royal nose the Liberals kept sticking his father&#8217;s
pledge of the glorious year, 1813. How about that long-promised
Constitution, your Majesty? Thousands of deluded
Prussians now believed that they could accurately define
the peculiar word &#8220;Liberty!&#8221; It looked as though the people
were bent on casting out a king. As yet there were in Prussia
no organized party lines; the general situation was
summed up in the growing hopes that the common people
placed in French constitutionalism&mdash;wherever that might
lead.</p>

<p>&para; At any rate, the old r&eacute;gime must go.</p>



<h5><a name="s22" id="s22"></a>22</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bad business, this promising a written Constitution&mdash;The
deluge breaks.</p></div>

<p>&para; The Prussian nobility, always bound to the King by feelings
of ardent loyalty, formed a military caste; the peasantry
was industrious, thrifty and hard-working; the State officials
were devoted to a spirit of discipline at once thorough
and pedantic; the Prussian school-system was first in square-headed
masters, who ruled with rods of iron. Thus, the Prussian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
National ideal was based on Discipline military in its
severity, self-sacrifice and energy. &#8220;Throughout Prussia was
a spirit of affirmation, expressive of the vigorous National
egotism. As time passed, the machine men of olden Prussia
were gradually replaced by free-willed, self-conscious citizens
taking an enlightened interest in their country; the old-time
tutelage headed by the monarchs underwent a transformation;
and the trend was toward enlightened self-government;
but many years were to pass before this ideal was
reached.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; William did indeed cherish, in a way, an idea of German
Unity, and in this respect he was a democrat or a radical,
whatever you wish to term him. Here, we must make one
fact plain. It will make you smile at William&#8217;s simplicity,
will show you how utterly he was out of touch with the
tendencies of the times; how good-natured he was; how honest
he was. He believed that German Unity, if ever it came,
should historically be an extension of the old Holy Roman
Empire, through the illustrious House of Hapsburg!</p>

<p>Which is equivalent to saying that your own family should
advance by humbling itself before your own greatest rival;
that you should bow to your political enemy and submit to
being effaced, to heighten your rival&#8217;s glory.</p>

<p>Strauss calls William &#8220;A romanticist on the throne of the
C&aelig;sars!&#8221; This Fr: William IV wished to be an absolute
monarch, after the traditional Hohenzollern style, yet he had
so few soldierly instincts that the army hated him.</p>

<p>&para; This political attitude with William was not a form of romantic
idealism bordering on lunacy; it was instead a token
of his blundering stupidity; also in a sense his four-square
frankness in owning that Prussia was playing second fiddle
to Austria, at this interesting moment. And, in truth, all that
William thought was logical; the stream was tending that
way; few denied it, except politicians interested in advancing
their own fortunes by setting Austria back in the great
game of grab. However, William, instead of loading cannon
and turning them on the Radicals, now swarming around his
palace, was much pleased to send a bishop to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>&para; Nicholas of Russia warned William to beware of democrats,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and to stand up for Divine-right of kings, but what
is the use of advising a coward to be a hero, a fool to be a
wise man? In the end, a man must go through life with the
sort of head he has&mdash;round, square, flat, or mushy&mdash;is it not
true? You are no exception, yourself; and our church-building
William, in turn, was true to his own &aelig;sthetic nature,
regardless of bayonets poked under his nose.</p>

<p>&para; Bad business this promising the people a written Constitution;
ominous for the breed of kings; a situation, in short,
not unlike that forced on the Grand Monarch at an earlier
day, that is to say, no money without the States&#8217; General.</p>

<p>&para; After 1840, Liberal opinions were directed against the
King, personally, charging him with political reactionary tendencies.
The course of popular liberty was taken by noted
men, among them Arnold Ruge, Karl Marx, Feuerbach,
Strauss, Bauer, Fallersleben, Dingelstedt, Meissner, Beck,
Kinkel, and others. Also, when Ischech attempted to assassinate
William IV, the dastardly act found supporters who
gloried in the &#8220;patriot&#8217;s&#8221; effort to rid the country of a
&#8220;tyrant,&#8221; even through cold-blooded murder.</p>

<p>&para; Also, the very memory of the frightful excesses of the
French Revolution still shocked the conservative political element
of Europe. The land-owning classes of Prussia, backed
by the Prussian army, stood shoulder to shoulder for their
old titles. The new call of political liberalism was, therefore,
in the view of Prussian conservatives, to be put down at all
hazards. The position was, of course, largely selfish, but it
was very human.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Matters came to a crisis in &#8217;47; King William IV needed
money for a little railroad project in East Prussia. In his
dilemma, he called his Baby Parliament, or Diet, April 11,
1847, and &#8220;deigned&#8221; to permit therein the right of petition;
there were in truth no privileges of political significance, no
real powers; it was a side-show, so far as the &#8220;people&#8221; were
concerned&mdash;and for eleven weeks volleys of oratory crackled
and thundered.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Here, we meet Bismarck face to face; and you should now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
be prepared, from what you have read, to understand the gigantic
problem Bismarck was called upon to face&mdash;single-handed!</p>

<p>&para; Furthermore, Bismarck&#8217;s attitude was not, as has often
been recorded, a case of &#8220;might is right.&#8221; The French Revolution
had proven conclusively that there can be no political
&#8220;right&#8221; without a political &#8220;might.&#8221; We should not forget
this fact throughout the Bismarck story of Prussia&#8217;s rise
to power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The voice in the Wilderness proclaims the God-given

<p>&para; The French Revolution brought to Paris adventurers and
patriots from every part of Europe. Among these was a
young Corsican who, with his mother and sisters, had been
driven out of his native island. This man, Napoleon Bonaparte,
was in the course of a few years to become Emperor
of France and Master of Europe.</p>

<p>&para; There is a classical picture of young Napoleon, at the time
of the early riots in Paris.</p>

<p>Standing on a curbstone, to one side, he watches the passing
of liberty-crazed mobs, armed with pikes&mdash;the self-same
common people on whose shoulders Napoleon himself was
later to ride into amazing power.</p>

<p>&para; Thus, likewise, in another time of political crisis, (1847-48)
men were flocking to Berlin to debate anew the well-worn
theme, &#8220;The Rights of Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quietly looking on was another man of destiny, Otto von
Bismarck, burly dyke-captain of the Elbe, up to that time
a farmer on his ancestral estates in Pomerania. What this
young blond giant saw before him was somewhat of this
extraordinary order:</p>

<p>&para; The universal theme was once more &#8220;Liberty,&#8221; and the din
not only in Berlin but throughout German states, was ear-splitting.
Of course, there were patriots who stood on broad
National grounds, but the purely personal point of view was
still very much in evidence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Every man had his say, often accompanied by brandishing
of fists or the laying on of canes; all dignified by the name
&#8220;patriotism,&#8221; but in truth it exhibited the old struggle of
human nature for supremacy.</p>

<p>The masses were fighting to unseat kings, whose dogma of
&#8220;Divine-right&#8221; had by the French Revolution been shown to
be only insidious political quackery, in the past sustained
largely by the sword. The common people were wrestling
to grasp this monarchic sword away, and here and there
had already seized the hilt or the blade&mdash;it mattered not
which!&mdash;and the dynasties of Hohenzollern, Hapsburg, Wittelsbach,
and all the lesser swarm, were suddenly put on the
defensive. Hotly pursued sovereigns kept their heads only
by some concession to popular fury; again, by flight. The
people were intoxicated with the wine of their newly found
power!</p>

<p>&para; And what would they do with their new bauble, liberty,
fraternity and equality? The centre of the stage was occupied
by a struggling mass of kings, fighting not only for
their crowns but for the very clothes on their backs! There
were poets in fine frenzy declaiming; grenadiers firing
muzzle-loaders; priests invoking the wrath of God; kings
shouting out that they were the only accredited earthly
representatives of Heaven; historians hotly insisting that all
were in error, and that the scroll showed this or that; law-givers
pleading for the old forms; lunatics laughing in demoniacal
glee; peasants armed with pitchforks jabbing right
and left; demagogues calling on Heaven to witness their lofty
and disinterested leadership; while around the edges of the
scene mountebanks, camp-followers, renegades, whores and
political blacklegs, were waiting for their share of the
plunder, let victory fall where it may.</p>

<p>&para; What a magnificent scramble for place, pelf and power! It
were blasphemy to call this riot the desire for progress for
the masses. It were equal blasphemy to call it stupidity and
reaction, on the part of the contending monarchs, as against
crushing with iron heel the hopes of the people for political
and intellectual life. Either one of these diagonally opposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
interpretations of the time is too extreme. The truth is in
neither view. As a matter of fact, behind the seething mass
of human forms was the age-old motive of human selfishness;
and while here and there some lofty soul may have
glimpsed in his fervid imagination a United Germany, based
on a &#8220;German national faith,&#8221; in which the rights of each
citizen should be no more or no less than the rights of all
others, with each man working for all men and all men for
each man, this poetical idea was only another evidence of
how the noblest minds place the illusion and the dream before
the appalling fact of human selfishness in the universal
struggle for personal aggrandizement.</p>

<p>&para; The merging of the various German states, or the transference
of land from one German monarch to another, in the
ensuing political struggle for power, is, after all, as nothing
compared with the change in ideas, now close at hand; what
may be called the &#8220;mind&#8221; of Germany was about to undergo
a veritable French Revolution! However, it was not to be
a French Revolution in the sense of mob-rule. We shall
make this clear as we come more especially to tell you, in
details, of a certain political millennium which Bismarck
scorned, although courageously pressed upon him by leaders
of the party of the people.</p>

<p>&para; On the whole, however, the drift of events was toward
&#8220;German national faith,&#8221; bringing in turn some form of
representative government, as against the doctrine of Divine-right
of kings. The monarchs were placed more and more
on the defensive; it was to be their last stand, not only for
their crowns but for their very lives!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; And now face to face with the gigantic problem of a
United Germany, again we study our last hope of kings&mdash;our
Prussian Strafford von Bismarck. In some respects he
is the historical foil of Strafford of Charles I, whose money-needs
compelled the calling of the Long Parliament; and the
help Strafford had given to the king in ruling without a parliament
had mortally offended the Commons; Strafford was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
declared guilty of high treason&mdash;and despite Charles&#8217; efforts,
Strafford went to the block!</p>

<p>&para; Will Bismarck come to a similar end on the scaffold of the
Prussian liberals?</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We see before us a giant in form and in mental strength;
a monster of will-power, with the iron ambition to compel
men to do his individual bidding; a political superman.</p>

<p>&para; He had spent his time more with cattle, horses and dogs
than he had with men.</p>

<p>&para; His spirit was high, untrammelled, rebellious. He ironically
despised the common people; the burden-bearers in all forms
of government were in this giant&#8217;s opinion not good enough
to sit beside kings.</p>

<p>&para; Morose, obstinate, self-opinionated, with an enormous capacity
for liquor, Bismarck was an intellectual as well as
physical glutton.</p>

<p>&para; Most of all, this strange man, half-beast, half-seer, was to
turn out to be the very voice of the old decaying kingcraft.
He had an immovable belief in the Feudal right of royalty
to rule over its subjects as it pleased; and by his amazing
power of intrigue supported by supreme abilities exercised
during the ensuing thirty years, Bismarck at last rose to a
height that overshadowed the monarchs whom he served&mdash;and
ruled!</p>

<p>We wish to emphasize, again, that Bismarck&#8217;s conception of
kingcraft was no mere despotic thing. To him, a king was
truly a man of great practical as well as moral responsibilities,
akin to father, hence should be obeyed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our young blond giant appears at Third Estates&#8217; Assembly&mdash;The
King&#8217;s predicament&mdash;Bismarck&#8217;s opportunity.</p></div>

<p>&para; Behold Otto Edward Leopold von Bismarck, the country
squire, straight from his cow-sheds and his hunting dogs;
a young blond German giant, 32 years old, in the very prime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of his massive strength and endurance; plentiful hair cropped
short, ruddy face, blond beard, bright blue eyes, big fists;
high, shrill voice, strangely out of keeping with his physical
bulk. For years afterward, this peculiar voice became the
stock in trade of newspaper writers. However, it was what
the giant said!</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck wore a broad-brimmed slouch hat, military boots
and his dykeman&#8217;s overcoat. This rough, yellow-colored garment,
for which he afterwards became famous, was long,
baggy and loose. He used to wear it when floods were high
along the River Elbe. In Berlin, at the time were only three
notables who wore these yellow overcoats: the first, Bismarck;
the second, the immortal Baron von Herteford, the last of his
race, hereditary grand huntsman at Cleve, and the third was
worn by Geo. Hesekiel, the German historian.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck, who was now to receive his first experience in
handling men in political alignments, had inherited a country
estate from the old family domains and was living the life
of a squire; hunting foxes, with dogs and gay companions,
passing nights in taverns, drinking heavily, eating like a
glutton, amusing himself as he pleased; a giant in intellect
and in stomach; turbulent, tempestuous, rough, a bad man
to cross, believe me, but among his cronies voted a prince
of good fellows. Such is our German hero as he comes upon
the great stage of affairs.</p>

<p>&para; When this burly Bismarck made his first entrance at the
Diet, or Assembly of the Three Estates, held in the &#8220;White
Saloon&#8221; of the Royal Palace at Coelin on the Spree, our future
empire-maker and throne-overturner knew by practical
experience absolutely nothing about the diagonal of political
cross-purposes.</p>

<p>However, he was now taking up his great life-study, entering
all unknowingly upon a magnificent career leading in
after years to his fair renown as Father of the German
Empire.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; He had, as we have seen, thus far passed the time as a
practical farmer; hale fellow well met, with upper-class
leanings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>After taking his doctor&#8217;s degree at Goettingen, he had made
a few journeys, one to Italy, another to the island of Heligoland,
on a shooting trip; had crossed the English Channel,
and had brought back with him a smattering of Shakespeare,
which he afterwards improved by considerable study; and
by the way throughout the crises in his career, Bismarck
often found refuge in apt Shakespearian quotations.</p>

<p>Then he had done a little governmental clerical work in the
lower courts of his country, but his peculiar ideas of independence
and his abruptness in speaking his mind unfitted
him for this work. Glad to be rid of his job, he returned to
the country. He knew nothing of administrative or executive
life, and aside from the fact that he was a student of
history, with a penchant for making historical parallels, there
was nothing to show the bent of his powerful mind.</p>

<p>&para; Yet, there is a great man before us! And since it is not
based on his training, then it must come inherently from
his natural endowment.</p>

<p>His master-mind was to unseat and seat princes, kings and
emperors, in the fullness of time, rearranging the map of
Germany to suit himself; engaging in three wars of ambition,
signally victorious in each; and winning for himself
imperishable fame during his active career of forty years.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; By a singular turn, Bismarck knew or cared so little for
politics, at this time, that his very entry into the &#8220;White
Saloon,&#8221; in which the Liberals decided to settle with this
stubborn King Fr: Wm. IV, was wholly by accident.</p>

<p>The Saxon Provincial Diet at Meresburg had chosen Dyke
Captain von Brauchitsch of Scharteuke, in the Circle of Jerichow,
as Deputy at the United Diet, and had selected Dyke
Captain von Bismarck of Schoenhausen as his proxy. As
Herr von Brauchitsch was very ill, his substitute was summoned.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck appeared as representative of the Knight&#8217;s Estate
of Jerichow, and vassal and chivalric servitor of the King.
How go the Fates! If the eminent von Brauchitsch had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
had the toothache, that day, there might not have been a
United Germany&mdash;is it not true?</p>

<p>&para; In the group that gathered in the &#8220;White Saloon&#8221; at Coelin
on the Spree, Bismarck met many men whose opinions were
well known to him; his brother, the Landrath, his cousins,
the Counts von Bismarck-Bohlen and von Bismarck-Briest;
his future father-in-law, Herr von Puttkammer; von Thadden,
von Wedell, and many others. Says Hesekiel:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Unfortunately these gentlemen in general, as Herr von
Thadden once bluntly said of himself, were not even bad
orators, but no orators at all. Nor could the two Freiherrs
von Manteuffel contend in eloquence with the brilliant
rhetorics of the Liberals, such as Freiherr von Vincke, Camphausen,
Mevissen, Beckerath, and others.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Few persons today can read those speeches of the First
United Diet, once so celebrated, without a melancholy or
satirical smile. Those were the blossom-days of liberal
phraseology, causing an enthusiasm of which we cannot now
form any adequate idea!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Troublous times indeed; and the King an autocrat of autocrats,
forced by the liberal ideas of the hour, breaking everywhere.
We can imagine William saying angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound the impudence of the Liberals with their crazy liberty,
fraternity and equality. We supposed that all this nonsense
was blown to bits by the guns at Waterloo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The bedeviled King began to show a streak of Prussian
stubbornness; in these angry words he incautiously addressed
those delegates who had dared to ask for a Constitution:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I refuse to allow to come between Almighty God in Heaven
and this Prussian land so much as a blotted piece of parchment
to rule us with paragraphs, and to replace thereby the
sacred bond of ancient loyalty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The widening gulf between monarchy and French constitutionalism
was now manifest to almost any thoughtful Prussian,
but, like the ostrich, our timid William continued to hide
his head under the sand and believed himself safe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For one whole month, burly Bismarck sits with his
mouth shut, seemingly stricken dumb at the sacrilegious
ideas of the Democrats.</p></div>

<p>&para; Now this giant dyke-captain, this lover of dogs, horses and
cattle, sat for one whole month, stricken dumb it seemed by
the political heresies that he heard. For one solid month, he
never opened his mouth! Then he could stand it no longer.
He pleaded vigorously for the Middle Ages feudal system,
and for the right of his own aristocratic class! In truth,
without knowing it, he was expressing the King&#8217;s sentiments,
was a genuine King&#8217;s Man.</p>

<p>&para; The future prince&#8217;s first speech swept like a hurricane over
a garden in June&mdash;withering, blasting, uprooting. He began
by denying, absolutely, that the great victory of 1813 which
expelled for Prussia the French invaders was based on so
low a consideration as the promise of a paper Constitution.
Not at all! It was an exhibition of pure patriotism. In his
historical reference, Bismarck, in this instance, was in error.
In no sense was &#8220;the people&#8221; to be credited with the great
Prussian victory of 1813; it came about largely through military
tactics, training and general preparedness, in which &#8220;the
people&#8221; had no part except to do their plain duty.</p>

<p>&para; For his remarkable utterance, Bismarck was promptly
hissed down by the Liberal side. Undaunted, Bismarck loaded
his heaviest guns against this thing called &#8220;Liberalism,&#8221;
with all its mock-heroics of liberty, fraternity and equality.
Would it not endanger our King&#8217;s sacred throne? That was
enough for Herr Bismarck.</p>

<p>&para; Thus the doughty Dyke-captain from the Elbe endeavored
to perform a political miracle&mdash;new wine in old bottles&mdash;and
as fast as the bottles popped, he put the wine in still other
old bottles. Was there ever more folly? Did a young champion
of the Crown ever make greater fool of himself?</p>

<p>&para; And with all Europe bawling for liberty, fraternity and
equality; with thrones tottering in every direction; with 23
of the 39 German states already joyously exhibiting their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
new Constitutions? Here was a voice in the wilderness crying
for monarchy and the Divine-right of kings! And what&#8217;s
more, gentlemen, he has before him a 30-years&#8217; fight, but
in the end will ram it down your throats.</p>

<p>&para; His cry at this moment is that ancient Prussian slogan,
&#8220;Mitt Gott fuer Koenig und Vaterland!&#8221; The question on
the proposed Constitution&mdash;the right of petition and certain
specified control over state finance by the people&mdash;simple as
all this seems today, created a terrible storm! The nobility,
led by the Dyke-captain, felt uneasy; a parliament of the
people was indeed a needless concession. And were the people
prepared by education for this great change? Was it
not hasty?</p>

<p>&para; Meantime, the King was in truth a sort of broken reed,
stirred by every blast that swept from the &#8220;White Saloon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Fr: Wm. IV was a &#8220;Hamlet-hesitating monarch,&#8221; who had
it not been for the burly giant Bismarck would have been
swept into oblivion by the first whiff of gunpowder. A stickler
for religious dogma, the pietists adored him, but the
classes despised him; he was one of those men who discuss
trifles with elegant ease, but who have no conception of what
is behind this present widespread demand for a constitution.
This King Fr.: Wm. IV lived in a mystic medi&aelig;val
dreamland; he restored the cathedral of Cologne; sent a missionary
band to spread his beloved Lutheran doctrines to the
Chinese, and established a Protestant bishop at Jerusalem.
The political literature of the time is overwhelmingly against
William. He did not understand the drift of events. Without
Bismarck, the King&#8217;s head would soon have rolled into
the basket!</p>

the rope&mdash;The new man explains his novel position,

<p>&para; There were three sessions of the Baby Parliament, and
Bismarck was soon looked upon as the conservative leader.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Perhaps conservative is not the word; reactionary would be
closer. There was no Conservative party, nor a Liberal party
for that matter. The obstinate fight with Bismarck was not
because he wished to prevent the common people from having
a share in their Prussian government, but because the
change, if ever it came, would set up a peculiar type of Prussian
government; a state-government, as it were, as against
the old-time liege-lord master-and-servant conception of Hohenzollern
&#8220;Divine-right&#8221; policy.</p>

<p>&para; The very word &#8220;people&#8221; threw Herr Bismarck into hysterical
frenzy! He determined upon resisting the heresy with
all the virile courage of his colossal bulk.</p>

<p>It had been his duty, as Elbe dyke-captain, to protect his
country against torrential waters; now he would do similar
service against the rising floods of revolution. He set up the
historical agreement that the edifice of Prussia, under an
aristocratic form of rulership, was firmer toward foreign foes,
firmer than was possible under the leader rule of the people.</p>

<p>&para; A conservative deputy from Pomerania, addressing the administration
member for West Havelland, said: &#8220;We have
conquered!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Not so!&#8221; replied Bismarck, coolly. &#8220;We have not conquered,
but we have made an attack, which is the principal
thing. Victory is yet to come, but it will take years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; These words accurately convey the nature of the situation.
Bismarck was master of short phrases in which complex
situations are summed up.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; He had dog-like love for his master, the King: &#8220;No word,&#8221;
he exclaimed, &#8220;has been more wrongly used in the past year
than the word &#8216;people.&#8217; Each man has held it to mean just
what suits his individual view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;We are Prussians,&#8221; was his eternal keynote, &#8220;and Prussia
is all-sufficient. Our hosts follow the Prussian flag and not
the tricolor; under the black and white they joyfully die for
their country. The tricolor has been, since the March riots,
recognized as the color of their opponents. The accents of
the Prussian National Anthem, the strains of the Dessau and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Hohenfriedberg March are well known and beloved among
them; but I have never yet heard a Prussian soldier sing,
&#8216;What is the German Fatherland?&#8217; The nation whence this
army has sprung, and of which the army is the truest representative
in the happy and accurate words of the president
of the First Chamber, Rudolph von Auerswald, does not need
to see the Prussian monarchy melt away in the filthy ferment
of South German immorality. We are Prussians, and
Prussians we desire to remain! I know that in these words
I utter the creed of the Prussian army, the creed of the majority
of my fellow-countrymen, and I hope to God that we
shall continue Prussians, when this bit of paper is forgotten
like the withered leaf of autumn!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Yes, Bismarck, any day the mob may bring the rope; but
you still bellow your defiance, your face of brass unabashed.
Man among men&mdash;wrong though you be, Bismarck, you will
have your say though the Heavens fall.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I am proud to be a Prussian Junker, and feel honored by
the appellation. Whigs and Tories were terms which once
also had a very mean signification; and be assured, gentlemen,
that we shall on our part bring Junkerdom to be regarded
with honor and respect.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Aristocrats were delighted; von Thadden exclaimed: &#8220;I am
enthusiastic over this man Bismarck!&#8221; Geo. v. Wincke, the
Westphalian high official, short, fat, red-headed, never admired
the burly giant Bismarck, smelling of the cow-sheds.</p>

<p>&para; For twenty years, off and on, the testy v. Wincke indulged
in invective, his theme ever being &#8220;The rule of law.&#8221; This
George v. Wincke in spite of his medals and his family tree
was on the liberal side, bag and baggage.</p>

<p>&para; There was a strain of bitter eloquence about this red-headed
champion of the people&#8217;s rights. He had read Guizot
and talked much of Hampden, the Long Parliament, and all
that. George had the legal side of the argument, especially
since the French revolution had set liberty bells a-ringing
everywhere, even in solemn old Prussia; but the doughty
Bismarck would come thundering back with his &#8220;unlimited
crown&#8221; and rulership over the people &#8220;by the grace of God,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8221;
royal prerogative and general disdain for the masses;&mdash;as in
the r&eacute;gime of Louis the Magnificent at Versailles, when the
convicts worked to build the $200,000,000 palace to shelter
art, wit and pretty women, while the people starved. How
out of tune, Bismarck; how hopelessly reactionary!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck voted against every new privilege. His speeches
read like reports of personal rows! He was frank, fearless
and frenzied, and in turn his volleys excited groans and
hisses.</p>

<p>&para; Was ever mortal so utterly out of touch with the prevailing
French conception of liberty, equality and fraternity?
Here is the way he summed up political equality:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;The goosequill arguments of newspaper writers!&#8221; &#8220;Relics
of pot-houses!&#8221; &#8220;The emancipation of the people does not
mean progress!&#8221; &#8220;A royal word is more than volumes of
law!&#8221; &#8220;The Prussian sovereigns are in possession of a crown
by God&#8217;s grace!&#8221; &#8220;The king has said he did not wish to
be coerced or driven!&#8221; &#8220;Let there be a period of four years,
at least, before another such stupid meeting as this is held.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; It was a curious situation. Bismarck was both rude and
crude!</p>

<p>His style of delivery was lame, his voice improperly placed,
his mannerisms grotesque. Despite his hobbling oratory,
however, Bismarck was soon a marked man; he held his audience
by his sensational ideas and his dogged courage!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Why did Bismarck vote against every new privilege?
This may not be decently answered in a word; you must read
on in detail; there was a great principle behind Bismarck&#8217;s
political attitude. True, it was crudely conceived and expressed,
at this period; but he will improve with time.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck well remembered the excesses of German Jacobins,
in the southwest, during the turbulent years of the
French Revolution. Alsace and Lorraine had welcomed massacres
as signs of political equality; mob leaders destroyed
castles and monasteries; Jew-baiters went mad; Schneider,
the tyrant of Strassburg, took charge of the guillotine, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
not making enough blood flow, was soon aided by professional
executioners, straight from Paris.</p>

<p>&para; There was also the lunatic &#8220;Feast of Reason.&#8221; Stark-mad
Germans paraded with Marat&#8217;s statue, attacked churches,
wrecked altars, heaped up images of saints, crosses, pews,
pulpits, and priests&#8217; garments, touched the match, and
danced around the fire;&mdash;while Schneider harangued the
mob on the joys of reason, as against revealed religion;
solemnly assuring his thousands of listeners that Christianity
was now a thing of the past.</p>

<p>&para; Thus the mad war of liberty burst forth, accompanied by
many extraordinary episodes. Nor were the followers confined
exclusively to the rabble; we find many noted teachers,
scholars and politicians endorsing the French guillotine as a
remedy for all political ills&mdash;men like Blau, Wedekind, Hoffmann,
Foster, Stamm, Dorsch, not overlooking the spectacular
John Mueller, who in the cause of the people committed unheard-of
follies with his pen, as a necessary support for the
sword.</p>

<p>&para; There was also a stark-mad leader named Cloots, who usually
signed his bulletins &#8220;Cloots, Personal Enemy of Jesus
of Nazareth.&#8221; His object was the union of all mankind,
literally speaking; no halfway measures for him, no long
delays; he wanted his political salvation here and now.</p>

<p>&para; So inflamed were the people that the discharge of a tailor&#8217;s
apprentice, in Breslau, precipitated a riot and the artillery
was brought into play.</p>

<p>&para; In Saxony, 18,000 peasants demanded a democratic constitution;
but the authorities replied by sending the messenger
to a mad-house.</p>

<p>&para; Thus, in various directions, the crack-brained revolutionists
played their parts; nor should history overlook the contribution
of the learned Dr. Faust, of Buckelburg, whose profound
treatise, &#8220;Origin of Trousers,&#8221; was read in Paris as a sort
of historical endorsement of the great democratic party that
gloried in the equality, not to say liberty, exhibited by casting
trousers aside.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Now what do you think? This King&#8217;s Man, sprung up of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a sudden, coming from his fox-hunting and his cow-sheds,
hits right and left at the Jews! Yes, as against his &#8220;beloved
Christians.&#8221; Here is a new note indeed&mdash;old yet new.</p>

<p>We had not supposed Jew-baiting a thing of the past; but
in these tempestuous times it did seem that race-prejudice
had no place in a plain attempt to keep a king&#8217;s crown.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I will pass,&#8221; Bismarck thundered, &#8220;to the question itself.
I am no enemy of Jews, and if they are enemies to me, I
will forgive them. Under certain circumstances, I even love
them. I would grant them every right&mdash;save that of holding
superior office posts in a Christian country.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I admit I am full of prejudices, sucked in with my mother&#8217;s
milk. If I think of a Jew, face to face with me as a
representative of the king&#8217;s sacred majesty, and have to
obey him, I must confess that I should feel myself deeply
broken and depressed. The sincere self-respect with which
I now attempt to fulfil my duties toward the state would
leave me! I share these feelings with the mass of large
strata of people, and I am not ashamed of their society.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Thus, now at this supreme moment, when with voice of
brass our Bismarck is making his entry into the world of
affairs with his sharp words on Christians and Jews, and
more especially with his uncompromising conception that
kings are indeed the personal representatives of God on this
earth, we do see that Bismarck stems from a fighting race.
All his years, this Bismarck was a frightful hater.</p>

<p>&para; With the sorry figure of the world-oppressed Jew in our
eyes and the malignancy of this new Jew-baiter, it is well
that at the very outset this be made clear: That whatever
Bismarck was or was not, at least he was no hypocrite. His
words always fall like the wrath of God.</p>

<p>It is a solemn fact that he changed his point of view many,
many times&mdash;even as you and I&mdash;but there is always the
ring of sincerity about it that even the acid test of long time
is unable to dissolve.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It was this tremendous earnestness&mdash;this sincerity&mdash;that
made Bismarck feared, hated and despised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Against your will, you are forced to believe what this giant
says, no matter how mocking, how insolent, how absurd his
charges!</p>

<p>Some tell us that Bismarck&#8217;s ancestry stems from Bohemia,
others trace the Bismarcks to Russia, still others assert Jewish
origin.</p>

<p>This much is a fact: from a geographical point, the family
name comes from the little river Biese, near Stendal.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s passion and prejudice against Jews was proverbial.
It did indeed often turn him, for the time being,
into a mad dog!</p>

<p>Near the close of life, in retirement at Friedrichsruh, some
candid friend desecrated the great man&#8217;s retirement by sending
him a copy of a book by an anonymous writer, &#8220;Bismarck,
the Jew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ordinarily, Bismarck paid no attention to social lampoons,
but on this day as he read the book aloud to guests, his
anger became black and terrifying!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I am determined to have the law on the audacious writer!&#8221;
Bismarck&#8217;s guests saw the old man in one of his moods of
frightful rage.</p>

<p>But next day something intervened&mdash;and Bismarck never
brought suit for damages.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Here is one thing that you must never forget in studying
great men: That it is possible, nay inevitable, for a man to
be at once very great and very small.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of his career, we find Bismarck
ringing the solemn changes on &#8220;Christian,&#8221; and we behold
him in a characteristically unamiable mood over &#8220;Jews.&#8221;
Yet all the time he was endeavoring to lay down the dogma
that the proper aim of the state is the realization of the
Christian ideal!</p>

<p>&para; If now you can understand this mental contradiction, you
are in a position to grasp one of the strange paradoxes with
which Bismarck&#8217;s life is literally filled.</p>

<p>You see here, at once, why he has been so often accused of
double-dealing, of stacking the cards, of changing his mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of going ahead by going backwards, winning ultimately by
fair means or by foul.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; And now for the sequel. Many years later, Bismarck was
exceedingly glad to be guided by the advice of Jews, more
especially the Jewish banker Bleichroder.</p>

<p>On one side of the table sits Bismarck, the Pomeranian
Junker, and on the other side the sallow-faced, undersized
Jew, Bleichroder.</p>

<p>Great friends they are today, to be sure; and between them
is a mound of treasury reports, telling in minute detail the
financial resources of Louis the Little, now a helpless prisoner
of war. France is at the Prussian&#8217;s mercy, and a Jew
is called in&mdash;a despised Jew!</p>

<p>Bleichroder and Bismarck coolly examined the balance sheets
of France, the present state of her debts.</p>

<p>The money cost turns out to be the stupendous sum of five
thousand millions of francs.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Literary and journalistic France, in book, editorial and
oration made a great outcry at the moment, declaring dramatically
that Prussian barbarians had decided &#8220;to bleed
France white&#8221;&mdash;attributing to Bismarck a figure of speech
borrowed from the butcher&#8217;s block! Well and good, but
France paid the indemnity in surprisingly short time; and
had many millions left to go on her way rejoicing, had it not
been for the miserable obsession, &#8220;Ravanche!&#8221; that kept her
in hot water for years.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck was correctly quoted in this respect: That gold
is as necessary in war as gunpowder; and the best way to
keep a quarrelsome would-be Napoleon out of war is to
empty his pockets.</p>

<p>&para; The Jewish feature, however, shows Bismarck, through and
through; and we could not present him without this surprising
scene. Make the most of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; &#8220;I do not much like the piety that proclaims itself,&#8221; said
Louis XIII. A similar remark may be made concerning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Bismarck&#8217;s life-long belief that the Lord was on Bismarck&#8217;s
side&mdash;Jew-baiter and all.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;The longer I work in politics,&#8221; he once remarked, summing
up his many political difficulties, &#8220;the smaller my belief
in human calculation. I look at the affair according to
my human understanding, but gratitude for God&#8217;s assistance
so far raises in me the confidence that the Lord is able to
turn our errors to our own good; that I experience daily, to
my wholesale humiliation.&#8221;</p>



<h4><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h4>

<h3>Bismarck Suffers a Great Shock</h3>


<h5><a name="s27" id="s27"></a>27</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Wherein it is shown that Bismarck&#8217;s protest against
disrespect for constituted authority was based on
certain tragic historical instances he would not repeat.</p></div>

<p>&para; It is freely granted that ideas of &#8220;Liberty!&#8221; that many
German patriots desired to see come to pass, in 1848, were
not those of 1789; but elements of lawlessness, of mob-rule,
of marchings to &#8220;Ca Ira!&#8221; of absurd glorification of the
common man, and of snarlings at kings as kings, were
largely in the spirit laid down by Robespierre, Danton, Marat
and that crew, with their chosen gangsters of the guillotine.
Bismarck would have none of it!</p>

<p>True, many of the old-line excesses were no longer used for
political purposes, but Bismarck was too well-balanced, had
too much common sense, in short was too strongly aligned
with landed interests to endorse &#8220;popular&#8221; government on
the old type from over the Vosges. His protests were all in
support of authority, discipline, duty, devotion to a deliberately
chosen monarch, who ruled by the will of God.</p>

<p>&para; In &#8217;48 the talk of the &#8220;Rights of Man&#8221; really meant the
rights of individual men&mdash;the tailor, the barber, the shoemaker&mdash;each
of whom felt that the time had now come to
overturn the political system of kings and to bring on the
rule of the common people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Old-line hatred of Napoleon had passed away. The French
military despot of the early part of the century was now
figured as a &#8220;great democrat,&#8221; whose wars had &#8220;all&#8221; been
in the interest of the people. Could anything have been
more absurd? The literary speculations of Rousseau, as to
the status of a new society (such, for example, as running
naked in the grove and rolling on the grass) were now replaced
by loud discussions not on the Rights of Man, as a
form of idealism, but the rights of all manner of men, each
of whom felt that, under the new dispensation, hastened if
necessary by bomb, dagger and poison-cup, the human race
was to rise to nobler political ideals. It is not difficult to
see that political theories of this sort have been indulged,
in one way or other, by every generation in revolt against
the settled ways of the fathers.</p>

<p>&para; Let us, therefore, go back to original sources and see for
ourselves just what account the common people had given
of themselves, in a political way, in France at the time of
her so-called political millennium. We shall then be able to
grasp Bismarck&#8217;s position clearly and be able at least to
understand, if we do not support, his attitude of uncompromising
severity toward popular rule, as understood at this
moment in the political evolution of Germany.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; If it be a mark of progress to call God a superstitious idol
and to endeavor by the guillotine to enforce political rights,
then the precious French key to the Door of Destiny for this
human race should be duplicated and placed in the possession
of nations, far and wide, as the final expression of man&#8217;s
best idea of himself, his wife, his child and his country.</p>

<p>This 1789-93 return to National paganism, both political and
social, is the mockery that Bismarck decided with all his almighty
strength, nay his supreme rage, to set aside; and
for him Prussian Militarism, which he so jealously set his
heart on, against the rising tides of French constitutionalism,
otherwise mob-rule, was at once to prove the sharp cure and
the dreadful counter-blow.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It was only after St. Helena that the Napoleonic legend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
presenting Napoleon as the great democrat, was brought
forward, to wit, that the Emperor&#8217;s many brutal campaigns
were in the interest of the &#8220;common people&#8221; instead of
gratification of his obsession for wars.</p>

<p>The transition came about in a simple way. The Emperor
was dead and gone; his fate on a distant black rock added
romantic interest to his lost cause; and the return of the old-line
French kings after Waterloo, under the bayonets of
Britain and the Allies, had proved a keen disappointment,
politically, to France. It is conceded that Napoleon had
promised and in many cases had applied liberal principles in
his conquered domains; but now that the man was dead,
agitators of many lands, including the 39 distracted German
states, began to take literally what the Emperor had
said in a sort of huge politico-military satire, to wit, that
his blood-letting was truly in the interest of the masses.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Hence, between 1815 and 1848, agitators of Germany began
ringing the changes on the glories of the French Revolution.
True, the Emperor had been dead some 20-odd years; a new
generation found surprising merits in his military plans,
forgetful of the lure of loot that had been the foundation
of it all; yes, for one thing the hungry desire of the landless
for the lands of the Catholic church.</p>

<p>&para; The exaggerated fact has been falsely set forth again and
again that the French peasant of 1789 was down in the very
mire of political despond, without a sou to his name; the
cock called him to work at dawn, and all for the good of the
aristocrats; he was penniless, he was an absurd figure, he
was not a man but a beast;&mdash;hence his righteous revolt in
the sacred name of Liberty.</p>

<p>&para; The fact is that at this time the French peasant was in
no worse condition than the working classes of other lands,
including Britain, Italy and Germany. That the Revolution
first broke out in France and not in the other countries
named is to be traced to journalistic and oratorical agitators
of the ward-politician type.</p>

<p>&para; The special taxes of which the peasantry complained did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
not exceed two per cent of the products of the soil; and it
is also a fact that France had a large and profitable foreign
trade; but French political and journalistic agitators were
afield, and the plain truth is that the landless desired to confiscate,
and did confiscate, the titles of those in possession.</p>

<p>No sooner was the gigantic confiscation of Catholic church
lands, amounting to about one-third of the soil of France,
or two billion five hundred million of francs in nominal value,
ordered by Mirabeau, backed up by the Revolutionary tribunals,
than the supposedly impecunious French peasants
came forward and purchased to the extent of millions of
francs; and it is a fact today (1915) that one of the secret
dreads of the French peasantry is that some sensational political
change may come in the stability of the French Government,
a change that will forfeit these old land titles,
based on confiscation in Revolutionary days.</p>

<p>&para; The French peasantry wants no great National military
hero to emerge from the war of 1915; and it is not unthinkable
that should a very strong French general suddenly come
forward, he would be removed by assassination; a thing that
has happened at least once before, in latter-day French
politics.</p>

<p>This confession of politico-social fears on the part of the
French peasantry explains why in France, take them as a
group, the candidates invested with the honors of the Presidency
are timid men, without ambitious political bias, and
why, on the whole, the modern French National instinct lives
in dread of a military hero, who with a turn of his wrist
might on the vote of his soldiers declare himself, let us say,
Emperor.</p>

<p>&para; Loaded down with debts incurred for various reasons, the
French of 1789 were on the verge of National bankruptcy.</p>

<p>This condition has usually been charged up against the excesses
of the French kings, such, for example, as expending
some 200,000,000 francs for pleasure-palaces, for the pretty
women around Louis XIV; but this charge will not bear the
light of modern research.</p>

<p>It is also a fact, on the practical side, that the much-boasted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
support given to America by the French in America&#8217;s Revolutionary
War, in a degree helped to bankrupt the French
government; but Americans have forgotten or wink at this
plain financial obligation.</p>

<p>&para; Also, the French Revolution had promised in its every
utterance the dawn of the political millennium, whereas instead
it brought an era of blood, idol-worship and free-love.
We are not discussing here those poetical French surveys of
the Rights of Man. Every ward-politician in Paris had the
list at his tongue&#8217;s end. There was some truth, much truth,
in many of these expressions, no doubt, as mere expressions
of humane sentiments. That, however, is another story.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; One has but to read the Memoirs of President Bailly of
the Revolutionary Assembly to find that mob-rule predominated
from the first day of the supposed &#8220;Dawn of the political
Millennium.&#8221; The mob in the gallery hissed or applauded
each speech, and deputies were intimidated.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck in his united Germany wanted no Jacobin Clubs,
largely composed of ward-politicians, and Bismarck wanted
no Marat with his vile newspaper, &#8220;Friend of the People,&#8221;
setting class against class.</p>

<p>&para; He wanted no guillotine as the German symbol of political
liberty. This political method of the guillotine was at best
only a cowardly form of assassination, ineffectual, barbarous.
First one side used it, then the other; then still another
group; each set of French political assassins prating of Liberty
had recourse to the guillotine to be well rid of rivals
much as in C&aelig;sar&#8217;s time the women of C&aelig;sar&#8217;s family,
that their own might be exalted, in turn proceeded to poison
prospective collateral heirs to the Imperial throne.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck knew all about this dirty French mess, parading
itself as the &#8220;voice of the people.&#8221; He was a strong man
himself and he was guilty of gross ambitions in his rise to
power, but on the whole Bismarck stood for self-possession
and for manly audacity, certainly not the French Revolution
type of audacity. It is a fact that Bismarck, as a human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
being, was a vast egotist, and had his own, ofttimes unscrupulous,
way of gaining his ends, but his conception of Militarism,
the force he did eventually use, was at bottom a
virtuous effort to support, liberate and unify the Fatherland,
not drag it into the mire of idolatry and bestiality.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We shall frequently say harsh things about Bismarck, in
this book; we do not wish to follow French methods and endeavor
to make an impossible hero of a man of clay. Bismarck,
as a man and in the methods of his rise to great
glory, had his gross faults, and we fearlessly point them out.</p>

<p>&para; But here are some of the facts that Bismarck can never
stand accused of, in the light of this much-boasted French
political &#8220;Millennium&#8221; of 1789-93, and here, likewise we find
the real reasons why he did struggle with all his might
against a reluctant people to enforce Militarism throughout
the jealous clashing 39 German states; and if Bismarck&#8217;s
exercise of the strong hand, in the bosom of the German
family was a fault, then at least it did not include these
French conditions, set up to cause the world to gasp in
admiration.</p>

<p>&para; The bull-necked Danton, the Parisian ward-heeler, in control
of public opinion, came on with his guillotine; and closed
the city&#8217;s gates against any man that had a dollar to pay
his debts or buy a dinner.</p>

<p>&para; The so-called &#8220;will of the people&#8221; was in short a spurious
affair, unnaturally created by a political morphine that gave
glorious dreams; and this wretched drug was supplied by the
mob-leaders.</p>

<p>All the blood-letting was represented as a harmless affair,
tending toward liberty and equality; all the confiscations of
church-lands and redistribution among the peasants was declared
a &#8220;great&#8221; political triumph.</p>

<p>Throughout even the loneliest country districts the word was
passed that the political millennium was about to break.</p>

<p>&para; The King was represented as a &#8220;monster fattening on
crime.&#8221; His wife was called an Austrian &#8220;panthress,&#8221; and
vile pamphlets were secretly passed around reflecting on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
character. God was represented as judging the King, and
the guillotine was awaiting Louis, by Heaven&#8217;s decree.</p>

<p>&para; The 26,000 priests who refused to take the oath of allegiance
to the monstrous political farce were visited with
all manner of persecutions; one section of Revolutionary
opinion decreed that death was the just due of all offending
pastors.</p>

<p>&para; The assertion of kept-historians that there was &#8220;political
justification&#8221; is at once spurious and an insult to common
sense.</p>

<p>&para; In justice to the better French element it is granted freely
that the dreadful September massacres did not express the
real beliefs of the great decent body of the French people;
but the Nation was dragged through the mire and the Nation
has for years been endeavoring to explain this political Millennium
of riots, murders, midnight assassinations, despoilings
of land titles.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck would have drained the poison cup rather than
stand for such French Constitutional nonsense in his beloved
Germany, the Germany of his dreams, the Germany for
which he labored so many years, the Germany which he
would save from itself, so to speak.</p>

<p>He purposed to build up German political opinion, not
through blatherskite ward-heelers, in Berlin, Frankfort or
Hamburg, but by a manly appeal to German common sense
and German sense of respect for authority; and if Bismarck
overworked his idea of Divine-right of kings, then at least
this may be said: that he issued no appeal to the German
people &#8220;Who Laughs on Friday, Weeps on Sunday!&#8221; (The
massacres had come between!) And as to Danton, who
glories in being the immediate instigator of the massacres
we have these, Danton&#8217;s own words: &#8220;It was I who caused
them. Rivers of blood had to flow between me and our
enemies!&#8221; Finally, after these rivers of blood, the word
was passed, &#8220;That the entire Nation will hasten to adopt this
(guillotine) most-necessary means of public salvation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; After reading five hundred pamphlets on the Revolution
(as she testified at her trial) Charlotte Corday struck down
Marat with a dagger; and her act has been generally condoned
by men with a sense of fair-play. It was indeed a
bloody murder; but when a mad-dog is running wild, a beast
fattening on human blood, one passion feeds on another&mdash;and
Corday is no exception. (Henderson, Symbol and Satire
of the French Revolution).</p>

<p>Heroine or monster, take your choice; at least in her time
such was the frenzy of the alleged political Millennium that
Marat was soon worshipped as a martyr. This atrocious political
quack, with all his daggers and his blackjacks, was
likened to Jesus Christ; and among the sentiments of the
hour we read, &#8220;A perfidious hand has snatched him away
from his beloved people&#8221;; &#8220;To the immortal glory of Marat,
the people&#8217;s friend&#8221;; &#8220;Unable to corrupt me, they have assassinated
me!&#8221; &#8220;Marat, rare and sublime soul, we will imitate
thee; we swear it on thy bloody corpse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such are some of the expressions of Liberty, Equality and
Fraternity that followers of French Constitutionalism had
years later decreed to re-enact in Germany; but Bismarck
stood as a master with a rod of iron to lay over the backs of
fanatical German Radicals, who would come on with their
drunken calls of &#8220;Liberty!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; All this, however, is only the mild opening chapter of this
much glorified French Constitutionalism. The French prisons
soon held about all there was of French intelligence and moderation;
the brains, the blood and the beauty. It is not necessary
to mention names.</p>

drunken era of French Constitutionalism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>At the height of the Terror, there were 8,000 political prisoners
in French dungeons; and the mobs still came on with
their cries for fresh blood. One day, this expression was
made: &#8220;The town of Lyons shall be destroyed; the name
Lyons shall be effaced,&#8221; etc. All this meant that Lyons,
weary of blood, had decided on raising an army to beat back
the sons of spurious liberty.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Any man who, in the Terror, dared disagree with the mob-rulers
was called a &#8220;conspirator.&#8221; In a letter from Herbois,
we find this plain evidence of political lunacy masquerading
as inspiration: &#8220;There are 60,000 individuals here who will
never make good republicans; we must have them sent away.
I have new measures in mind, weighty and effectual,*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*
Heads, more heads, heads every day! *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* How you

guillotining and fusillading are not going badly!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The Queen, now in her dungeon, was treated with wretched
dishonor. Even the petty expenses of bread and salt were
begrudged: 15 francs a day for food; three francs and 18
sous for trimming a skirt, 18 sous for a ribbon and shoe-strings;
three francs for a tooth wash;&mdash;all this was kept
track of. Yet in years gone by France had allowed her
four million francs of pin money, and the royal allowance
was twenty-five millions of francs per annum.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Through a small window in her cell comes the light of day.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* She is accused of being a leech, a scourge, a harpy
and a free-lover; she is condemned to death.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The political assassins, known as the Mountain, and that
known as the Girondists, now began destroying each other;
every patriotic action of the Girondists was set forth as having
been instigated by love of vulgar applause. After some
days, the Jacobin Club petitioned for freer trials, less hindered
by legal formalities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

Executions continued, day by day.</p>

<p>&para; The poor king was long since dead and gone, yet his memory
was detested.</p>

<p>On a certain day of horrors, the tombs of his ancestors were
broken open by the mob, and the bones scattered. One corpse
(or what remained of it) was stood up against a wall and the
beard hacked off by a patriot of the new Regime.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; All authority was now overthrown; and as one writer adds,
&#8220;the most daring enterprise of the Revolution remains to be
chronicled: the storming of Heaven!&#8221; (Henderson.)</p>

<p>&para; The leaders decided next to attack God on His throne; God
was officially declared a superstitious myth.</p>

<p>The altars of France were hurled over; the Christian era was
abolished by political decree; the Sabbath day was officially
proclaimed done away with; Christ was to be henceforth
banished, officially; churches closed, pagan rites substituted.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck, the thinker, Bismarck, the builder, with his
dream of political responsibility, of vested Authority, stood
for no such facts in his protests against the rising tide of
Radicalism, in the German states.</p>

<p>He knew his history too well; he knew the satire of the
French Revolution, the folly of meeting it in any way except
by the sword.</p>

<p>&para; Yes, Bismarck believed strongly in what has since been
called Militarism; but his idea was that power was needed
for the liberation and the unification of his country; and he
hated French Constitutionalism and fought by fair means
and by foul all efforts to warp upon Germans the political
ideals of the French Revolution. So you must here and now
make up your mind whether or not Bismarck was a great
statesman or a great fool.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The French Convention, weary of blood-letting, began maundering
in the psychology of religion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>It was officially set forth by one of the Deputies that, after
all, the idea was to invent some new form of religion, without
which the proposed political Millennium had fallen short.</p>

<p>Marat was turned to, that choice spirit of the height of the
era; though in his tomb, he was called upon in this strange
language, despite his bringing in the Terror:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;O, heart of Jesus, O heart of Marat, you have an equal
right to our homage!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; A New Era was now decreed, taken in the main from the
paganism of early France. The four seasons were symbolized
by the hunt of the man for his mate: he is afield in
Autumn, on horseback; in Winter, he first finds his new mate;
in the Spring, the maid watches her sheep feeding on the
hills; and in Summertime, the man is seen leading his mate
to a couch, his arms already around her waist.</p>

<p>&para; One of the leading symbols was Reason, presented as a
lady petting a lion; saints&#8217; days were replaced by days for
animals, one for the cat, the dog, the sheep, and what you
will; but no longer St. John&#8217;s, St. James, St. Louis.</p>

<p>Certain other days, dedicated to the &#8220;Spirit of the Revolution,&#8221;
were termed &#8220;Sans culotte,&#8221; or without trousers, to
wit, the French version of that great idol of the American
yellow editor, who cries for justice in behalf of the man with
the seat out of his trousers.</p>

<p>&para; On a certain day, the Cathedral of Notre Dame was used
as a background for the great French political drama; a
mountain was erected, a figure known as Truth was present.
The Goddess Reason was also carried to the Tuileries; and
later as a report written at the time says, &#8220;The President of
the Convention gave the Goddess a fraternal kiss, whereupon
his secretaries asked and obtained a similar privilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; At Rochefort the orator of the hour began, &#8220;Citizens, there
is no future life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The images of saints were replaced by men of the stripe of
Marat, Brutus and other tyrants.</p>

<p>&para;Also, an ass was dressed in pontifical robes at a sort of
National fete, and a few days later at a public masquerade,
the President replying to praises of the New Era explained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
himself as follows: &#8220;In one single instant you make vanish
into nothingness the errors of eighteen centuries&#8221;; by which
he meant to honor the paganism of the new French political
Millennium.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Now comes that dangerous man, king of political charlatans,
Robespierre, who offers a private religion of his own.</p>

<p>&para; The queer thing about this Robespierre, the new dictator,
is his belief that he and he alone is the fountain of all political
virtues. One must be willing to sacrifice brothers,
mother, sister, father to the guillotine&mdash;for the good of one&#8217;s
country.</p>

<p>The Robespierre idea is that the supreme duty of a Nation
is to repress &#8220;crime,&#8221; as well as to uphold &#8220;virtue&#8221; and
&#8220;crime&#8221; consists largely in not agreeing with the great central
authority. He has had many followers since that day.</p>

<p>&para; Robespierre was really a great man gone wrong; he had
in many respects a brilliant mind; he was a profound orator;
a born leader; but he was unsound at the core, like a rotten
apple; taught bloodshed and violence, as expressions of National
honor.</p>

<p>&para; In one picture of the hour, he is represented as the Sun,
rising over the Mountain, and Giving Light to the Universe.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The day dawns when Robespierre has his old friend and
rival Danton on the scaffold. This was to be expected. Then
followed many executions of Dantonists.</p>

<p>&para; Robespierre now came on with his &#8220;new&#8221; religion; he boldly
announced a Supreme Being and belief in immortality!</p>

<p>&para; He applied the torch to the wooden images set up by his
political predecessors. He made a speech that is unintelligible,
all wind, sound and bombast, but was cheered to the
echo.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Are you not growing weary of all these absurdities? Perhaps
you think the details taken from the records of Bloomingdale
Asylum?</p>

<p>No; French Constitutionalism of 1789-93, the sort that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Radicals of Germany had in mind, (with some variations),
and often extolled in fiery speeches of the German Liberal
party that Bismarck decided to crush down, with a rod of
iron. True, the old offensive historical details were kept out
of sight and were not fresh in men&#8217;s minds;&mdash;except reading
men and thinking men, like Bismarck; men bold enough
to stand out against mob-violence, called by whatever soft
name you please.</p>

<p>&para; A French cartoon of the Robespierre Regime made at the
time by an admirer shows the earth around the guillotine
heaped with heads, and at last the over-weary executioner,
failing to find further victims, decides to execute himself!
He is therefore seen lying under the axe, his head rolling
on the floor.</p>

<p>&para; Robespierre in the end went the way of all the other political
fanatics; the day came when he was spat upon, struck,
beaten by mobs, pricked with knives.</p>

<p>According to his own theory, he needed no trial (said his
new rivals and enemies in their lust for power), for he has
by his acts shown himself to be an enemy of his country.</p>

<p>They carried him down the great staircase; he fought back
savagely, like the frightful animal that he was.</p>

<p>&para; Eighty-two of his followers died that day, on the guillotine.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Long live the Republic! Long live Liberty!&#8221; was the loud
cry of the rabble.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Such is some of the work of the great legislators of the
Republic of Equality as set forth by the various authors of
the new French &#8220;political Millennium,&#8221; during those terrible
years 1789-93; we have seen their ideas on a grand scale;
and it is for you to judge whether in setting himself squarely
in favor of Discipline and respect for constituted Authority,
as exemplified by the line of Prussian kings, and the Prussian
system of education, Bismarck was to show himself a
man or a mouse.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck, who was a deep reader on politics, knew well
the frightful excesses of French mob-rule. He may also
have recognized certain general excellent principles, but he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
would have nothing to do with the fungous growth. And as
we follow his career, we see the virtue in his strong reliance
on Militarism, as an arm to keep in check the turbulent
German masses, also, later, this same Militarism to be used
to do battle for the German Empire.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; For many years, all manner of rosy democratic plans had
been voiced by the Liberals.</p>

<p>The thing had been done to death. Every manner of political
Utopia had been planned by theorists, but Bismarck
met them all with his ironical speeches, and bided his time.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s idea was that the only hope for German unity
came through accepting the King of Prussia as ordained
of heaven.</p>

<p>In his arguments, he ignored the masses, the villagers, the
workers, the busy-bees, the regard for individual rights.</p>

<p>His whole programme seemed to the masses to be anti-Christ
in conception, that is to say, it harked back to political
paganism.</p>

<p>&para; It is very difficult for an American to comprehend this
Prussian conception of Divine-right, as a political principle&mdash;but
it should not be difficult from the point of human experience.
Bismarck had no illusions concerning the power
of the average man, and he held that the phrase &#8220;the people&#8221;
was used by every political quack in Europe for any one of
a thousand selfish motives.</p>

<p>Bismarck had absolutely no faith in the power of the average
man to govern himself&mdash;much less to govern others!&mdash;or
faith in the average man doing anything above the average,
outside his own small trade or craft.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Americans are accustomed to make much of an alleged
saying of Lincoln: &#8220;No man is good enough to govern another
without that man&#8217;s consent.&#8221; It is all a beautiful
dream, false in theory and false in fact, belied by every record
since the Lord drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden
of Eden.</p>

<p>Beginning with that stupendous episode, certain it is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
this act of government was not carried out with, but against
the will of the ruled; and the point at issue was not the
supreme goodness of the ruler, but the power to station an
angel with a flaming sword at the gates, toward which Adam
ever after looked backward with longing eyes&mdash;but looked
in vain!</p>

<p>&para; In the innumerable dynasties of Babylon, Nineveh, Egypt,
Greece, Arabia, Armenia, what man ruled who did not force
his leadership?</p>

<p>It is not in the nature of human beings to accept new ideas
without hostile objection.</p>

<p>This holds true also in the evolution of governments, for all
life is founded on struggle, and the man who would rule
must force his leadership or remain unknown.</p>

<p>&para; Lincoln is absolutely in error, and his much-quoted words
are folly. It is not a question of goodness, or badness, or
fitness, on part of the man who has the ambition to rule,
but it is very much a question of his courage, his craft or
his cunning in compelling others to do his bidding.</p>

<p>Julius C&aelig;sar was not selected to rule, but he selected himself;
and so did Charlemagne, and Bismarck&mdash;and so Lincoln,
himself.</p>

<p>&para; If some concession to the democratic system is sought on
the ground that the voice of the people loudly &#8220;called&#8221; Lincoln,
then it is to be set up that Lincoln on his part was
one of the shrewdest political log-rollers this nation has ever
seen; and if he did not originate the canvass that busies
itself kissing the babies, congratulating the wives and shaking
hands with the farmers, then at least Lincoln was an apt
pupil.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable that, without his own high ambition, his
long and painstaking endeavors to trim sail to every favoring
gale (for example his shifting positions on the slavery
question), he would have been nominated for President of
these United States.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It is an amiable conceit of human nature, looking backward,
to profess to see what it blindly ignored, looking forward;
and go to any penitentiary in America, ask the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
convicts, and you will find that, according to the stories,
there are no guilty men behind the bars; invariably a peculiar
complication of circumstances enabled the guilty man
to escape, and justice was thereupon avenged by a human
sacrifice; likewise in the United States Senate or in the
House of Representatives, ask whom you please, &#8220;How came
you to hold your seat?&#8221; and you will find no ambitious man.
Some were forced to stand against their protests; others
were away traveling when word was received, by telegraph,
&#8220;You have been elected!&#8221; Still others appealed to the nominating
committee, &#8220;For the love of God desist!&#8221;&mdash;but in
vain.</p>

<p>Thus, without raising a finger to direct the movement of
events, our leaders were selected by an omnipotent democracy
to occupy the seats of the mighty.</p>

<p>&para; Truly, no man is good enough to rule another without that
other man&#8217;s consent! Recast in terms of human experience,
it would mean that we would go unruled; for no man yet has
willingly selected his ruler, but has had dominion over him
thrust upon him&mdash;even as Bismarck expressed his right to
rule, backed by blood and iron.</p>

<p>Such is human nature since the world began; otherwise why
was Christ, the gentlest ruler of all time, brought to the
tree; Socrates forced to drink the hemlock by the very wise
justice of his day; and Columbus called a madman because
he wished to rule men&#8217;s minds with a new truth, showing
clearly that the world is not square or flat, but round like
a ball?</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck had the real clue&mdash;and forced his purpose
through the power of his commanding personality.</p>

<p>&para; Thus, between 1815 and 1848 German Unity had been
stimulated by a dozen causes, religious, commercial, literary,
social&mdash;but the political lagged, for the fact is that about
the last thing a man learns is to govern himself.</p>

<p>There was a rising sense of National faith, as predicted by
Arndt, the poet of German brotherhood; also the call of
blood, based on language; likewise a deep yearning, as yet
unsatisfied, for a constitutional form of government, as
against the warring, insolent 39 states.</p>

<p>&para; By 1848 there were Constitutions in 23 of the states; many
of these documents illiberal to be sure; but nevertheless a
step in representative government.</p>

<p>&para; But the Germans are a peculiar people. They wish to
refer everything to ultimate philosophical causes; hence the
fruitless debates of the Frankfort Convention, in which all
manner of prospective Constitutions were tried by the formal
rules of philosophy and ethics. Such questions as &#8220;What
is a Federal state?&#8221; were angrily debated, and the changes
rung on &#8220;federation of states.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; After worlds of talking, unseen hands decided to offer to
some powerful prince the German crown. How is that for
democrats? William IV was the man selected.</p>

<p>&para; Prodded by Bismarck, who was always explosive and satirical
about democratic crowns, William spunkily refused to
&#8220;pick a crown out of the gutter!&#8221; His dignity, as a Hohenzollern
was offended; but Bismarck was playing for larger
stakes. William now went about canvassing the German
princes for a crown; twenty-eight replied, one way or another;
others, sticking to selfish interests, made no acknowledgment.</p>

<p>&para; Now Bismarck, bellowing like a mastiff, set up the cry
that if William accepted that democratic crown out of the
Frankfort gutter, Prussia would become involved in civil
war. And it was a fact! The old-line Prussian military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
aristocracy wanted no &#8220;democratic gold, from the gutter,
melted down with their old aristocratic gold of Frederick
the Great&#8221;&mdash;and as a matter of fact, could you blame them?
Were you there, at the time, and of the land-holding privileged
class, you too would have been up in arms.</p>

<p>&para; Get this straight: William&#8217;s idea of &#8220;United Germany&#8221;
simply meant that there should be a United Germany compounded
of the thirty-nine clashing states, provided William&#8217;s
beloved Prussia and not the detested Austria could
front the movement.</p>

<p>&para; Despite all the noble souls who write poetry on brotherhood
(and Germany has her patriots, God knows!), the
irony of fate is such that all human alignments of a political
nature must at some stage be spattered with mud.</p>

<p>&para; You see, henceforth for a quarter of a century, the realization
of this much-prized but elusive and seemingly impossible
Unity was to become more and more a game of politics
in which the stakes were kingdoms, principalities, riches and
honors unnumbered. In all card-games the result is not
known till the last card is played; and in the present case
the game was to be protracted twenty-four years. Chips
were flung about in huge stacks, now piled on the Austrian
side, now on the Prussian; and finally, it was to break up
in a fight, in which Prussia had to tip over the table, violently
seize the spoils, batter heads right and left, and beat
off rival players with needle-guns.</p>

<p>&para; Come, come, there is no need of claiming too much for
human nature. The grand prize was to be gained, ultimately,
by seizure! Even the sober, common-sense William
I, to whom it finally fell to be crowned German Emperor,
saw the true situation early, after the church-building William
IV had been gathered to his fathers. You will hear
more of that as we go along.</p>

<p>When all intriguing, all card-stacking, all smiling, all smooth
speeches no longer serve to conceal the real end of this
amazing game of international politics, as between Prussia
and Austria, then the thing to do is to bring on &#8220;blood and
iron.&#8221; The very human end that Bismarck always had in
mind was German liberation and Unity, by driving the Nation&#8217;s
enemies beyond the borders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; The best title to lands, the surest, the most incontrovertible&mdash;let
purists and pietists rage as they may&mdash;is the sharp
edge of the sword.</p>

<p>We shall see all that more clearly as the bloody years go by.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; In the critical year &#8217;48, democratic mobs chased that old
aristocrat and king-maker Metternich out of Vienna. Hungary,
Bohemia and other intervening principalities went mad
with excitement about &#8220;Liberty!&#8221; South Germany was in a
turmoil.</p>

<p>William IV had again practically promised a Constitution,
and had ordered the troops from Berlin; he placed a sign on
his castle &#8220;National Property.&#8221; At this time the king let slip
these fateful words, &#8220;Prussia is to be dissolved in Germany!&#8221;
Bismarck, pained beyond expression, sent a letter to the King,
full of expressions of loyalty. The King kept the letter on
his desk all summer.</p>

<p>&para; The giant continued to protest. He now first used a subsidized
press, called well-known men to write for the &#8220;North
Prussian Gazette.&#8221;</p>

<p>For all this, he was dubbed &#8220;Junker,&#8221; &#8220;Hot Head,&#8221; &#8220;Reactionary,&#8221;
but he thundered away like a battleship in action.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The King was in the hands of the Liberals. Bismarck regarded
this as a frightful situation. Bismarck, of the Old
Regime, stood by the landlords and the titled folk. He had
prodigious pride of station, hated to see the King make a
fool of himself about paper Constitutions.</p>

<p>&para; In Berlin, along in March, there were amazing scenes. The
democrats were crazy for blood; William shrank with horror
against fighting his beloved Berliners. But this son, the future
William I, who twenty-four years later was to gain the
imperial German crown, was not so squeamish. The young
prince gained the popular title &#8220;Cartridge-box prince,&#8221; equivalent
to saying that he was willing to blaze away at &#8220;beloved
Berliners,&#8221; or at any other citizens insane with political
excitements hazardous to &#8220;Divine-right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; It is true that on March 18th this romantic William IV did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
indeed enter into negotiations with the insurgents; and&mdash;think
of the mortification to one of Bismarck&#8217;s upper-class
leanings!&mdash;did indeed do no less than wrap the German tricolor
around his body and heading a democratic procession
march around the streets, even going so far as to make a
foolish speech in which he extolled the glories of the German
democratic revolution.</p>

<p>&para; Here we might as well close the book, were it not for Bismarck.
The surly dog of a king&#8217;s man flatly refused to vote
&#8220;Aye!&#8221; in the Diet, where the hot-heads were intent on passing
resolutions &#8220;commending the King for his loyalty to
democratic principles,&#8221; in marching &#8217;round town with the
mob. Bismarck for the time being stood like a great mastiff
at bay before wolves.</p>

<p>His terrific speech upholding royal prerogative made his early
and sudden fame.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It is a fact that with all their political ambitions, and their
solemn belief that Germany&#8217;s political future was an open
book, the Radicals in Prussia never guessed the way events
were to turn out; nor for that matter the Radicals never desired
the conquest of Germany by Prussia; therefore the subsequent
astonishing rise of German Imperialism through
Prussian domination, would have proved a most surprising
revelation had the patriots of 1806 to 1848 returned from the
other world, say in 1870, to view Prussia&#8217;s rise to glory.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The political uprisings of 1848 had parallels in Italy,
France, Spain, and Germany; and the excesses cleared the
way for wiser action, in years to come.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;The frenzy was a sort of tottering bridge between the
French 1789-93 idea of democracy (that has to do with
bloodshed and violence) and the purified conception expressed
in modern constitutional democracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The German democratic uprisings of 1820, &#8217;30 and &#8217;48 were
planned to win a certain type of civil liberty. They failed.
The question was &#8220;equality,&#8221; as well as popular &#8220;machinery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>&#8221;
of representation. How was it to be brought about? Modern
&#8220;parliamentarism&#8221; had not as yet been involved.</p>

<p>&para; The patriots of &#8217;48 had their Jacobin clubs in mild imitation
of the French Revolution. Baden alone had 400, with a
membership of 20,000. &#8220;Every tavern and brewery, (Dahlinger,
German Revolution of &#8217;49, p. 33), became a seat of
democratic propaganda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Copied from French models was the word &#8220;Citizen.&#8221; We
hear of Citizen Brentano, Citizen Franz Sigel, Citizen Ostenhaus,
Citizen Schimmelpfennig; some of these leaders were
extremely radical; but Brentano endeavored to keep the
Revolution from becoming a record of lawlessness after the
French Revolution type. (Dahlinger, p. 100).</p>

<p>We cannot go into the various battles fought and lost.
Many of the leaders were exiled, others shot. The patriots
were as a rule young collegians, ambitious to rise in life, but
sincerely holding to modified conceptions of French Constitutionalism.
There were a large number of journalists in
the thick of the struggle, also professors in high schools.
These chosen leaders, by various oratorical tricks, drew political
and social malcontents from every walk of life.</p>

<p>&para; In the end, Prussian troops put down the patriots.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; In &#8217;48, all kings were under suspicion; it made no difference
whether the king was a good king or a bad king; a king was
a king, and all kings were bad.</p>

<p>The younger generation, especially became morbid over the
word &#8220;Liberty!&#8221; What it really meant, in &#8217;48, was that
human nature should restrain itself, in order that all men
might, immediately, enter into so-called God-given political
rights.</p>

<p>The situation was somewhat analogous to that created after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the Civil War, in the United States. Certain political fanatics,
weeping over the Negroes, now demanded universal
suffrage, literally, for the slaves, and in secret saw that by
controlling the South, a &#8220;Black Republic&#8221; might be set up,
side by side with our &#8220;White Republic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Fraternity and equality&mdash;that was the cry in &#8217;48&mdash;glossed
over by politico-religious glamour, expressed in the idea that
men &#8220;ought&#8221; do thus and so, and therefore &#8220;a people&#8217;s king&#8221;
was in order. The people were to crown themselves.</p>

<p>For a thousand years the accepted political doctrine had been
that kings held office by Divine-right, but now orators of the
day harangued mobs proclaiming the literal belief that the
voice of the people is the voice of God.</p>

<p>While, thus, the new apostles ridiculed the old idea of Divine-right,
as attached to the acts of monarch, leaders of the
people saw no inconsistency in asserting attributes of political
divinity in the doings of the common people. Thus,
a species of nebulous politico-religious humanism was pictured
as the highest expression of political philosophy.</p>

<p>The individual wished to come into his own and the quicker
the better. Reformers shocked landed proprietors, titled
folk and office-holders under kings, by demanding unconditional
surrender of the machinery of government; zealots
urged revolts against all manner of constituted authority.
The point was to gain for the barber, the tailor, the shoemaker
and the blacksmith more life, more political experience,
more freedom of choice&mdash;and right on the next tick
of the clock!</p>

<p>&para; There is this about it: that the Frankfort Convention offered
to William IV the &#8220;People&#8217;s Crown&#8221; as a direct symbol
of belief in political idealism, not necessarily, however, the
political idealism that tolerates a king but instead uses him
as a popular signboard.</p>

<p>The Convention held that German unity &#8220;ought by right&#8221; to
be established; therefore &#8220;once the grand Idea was set
afloat&#8221; the cause &#8220;must by moral right come to pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Probably never before in the world was there formulated
an outright, widespread expression of greater political
idealism by men who called themselves patriots. There is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
noble side to the sentiment, heightened the more as we realize
the inevitable delusion of it all, translated into terms of
human selfishness.</p>

<p>Germany, so the zealots proclaimed, should by blood and
language be united; and in this respect orators of the hour
were correct.</p>

<p>Germany had a manifest destiny, the speakers continued,
but in this respect they were guided by faith rather than
by experience. At least, the momentary end of &#8220;manifest
destiny&#8221; was clearly the political function; to be one and
united.</p>

<p>&para; So far good.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Then why &#8220;should not&#8221; this noble German Idea be &#8220;accepted&#8221;?
The word Idea was usually presented with a capital
letter, in form of personification, so real had the thing
become to German political orators.</p>

<p>Certainly every German was ready to testify that National
Unity had been the one political dream of generations past
and gone.</p>

<p>Had not the old wandering minstrels sung of the Fatherland,
alas, too long delayed by miserable human selfishness!
German bull-headedness insisted on insularity, on individualism,
on particularism, on standing each petty monarch in
his corner, with farce-comedy courtiers bowing and scraping
while the rights of the peasant were forgotten. Assuredly,
the day had come for this folly to cease. Then in Heaven&#8217;s
name, why not a United Germany&mdash;here and now?</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The petty passions of rival princes acted as a bar to the
acceptance of the glorious National Idea, spelled with the
big &#8220;I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Intense particularisms preferred loyalty to local princes,
fashions, customs, dialects rather than to lose the old ways
in the larger life of the German Nation.</p>

<p>&para; But Bismarck did not lose heart.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We will never get at Bismarck through a study of
the interplay of politics; suppose we state his case
in terms of human nature?</p></div>

<p>&para; From this time on, the shelves are freighted with volume
after volume of German political jargon, forming a bewildering
diagonal of forces crossing and recrossing in thousands
the tangled threads. Bismarck&#8217;s presence runs
throughout, but it is a long and complex story, hard to comprehend
and difficult to compress without sacrificing important
details.</p>

<p>&para; We find &#8220;Grand Germans&#8221; against &#8220;Petty Germans&#8221;;
Grimm, the philologist, has his say against Simson, the jurist;
Arndt, the poet, against Welcker, the publicist; the
Frankfort parliament offering its paper crown to the King
of Prussia, imploring him to become a democratic liberator
and unifier; and on the other hand we hear Bismarck in the
Berlin Diet, urging the king to stand firm for the Old Regime;
arks of free-speech from Polish insurgents, also ill-advised
youth waving banners of blood; mobs in the Berlin
streets, whiffs of grapeshot here and there to clear the air;
John of Austria urging something and the Prince Consort of
England advising, post-haste, the kings of Prussia, Bavaria,
Saxony and Wuertemberg; the Assembly manufacturing
Magna Chartas, after noisy clashes of opinion.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;There is not enough practical sense behind all,&#8221; says Bismarck,
&#8220;to build a political chicken-coop, to say nothing of an
empire.&#8221; Then, the patriots, so-called, leave for America,
worn out with waiting for some new freedom set down on
paper; and of the motley crew, not one is sufficiently wise,
or strong enough to make head or tail of the complex situation.
Barricades are thrown up, artillery plays upon the
mobs, and general blood-letting follows; thousands of lives
are snuffed out, to be charged up as advance sacrifices
for political cohesion. Hapsburger against Hohenzollern,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Protestant against Catholic, Ultramontanes beholding the
reign of Anti-Christ; Guelphs and Wittelsbachs, protesting
their own peculiar and ancient lineage against self-seeking
latter-day upstart aristocrats!</p>

<p>&para; And the problem grew darker as the months went by.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; You may read till you are dizzy and then stand back and
try to get a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the complicated quarrels of
the Diet; the vagaries of Frankfort or Berlin; the brawls
of this poet, that student, editor, publicist, or princeling;
with soldiers of fortune hovering around waiting, like vultures
that have already a whiff of the carrion, from afar.
Instead of a bird&#8217;s-eye, the incoherent mass of details comes
piecemeal, and you get the toad&#8217;s-eye view;&mdash;till we apply
the simple idea that behind it all is elemental human nature,
with politics as a mere frame to the picture.</p>

<p>&para; Look on Bismarck at this moment as one dealing with
forces of human nature, the clash of many minds, ending by
dominating over one and all, years hence, through his own
inherent sagacity as a human being against other and
weaker members of his kind&mdash;and we get at once a significant
conception of the greatness of Bismarck&#8217;s mentality,
also of his innate craft, enabling him to triumph over a
thousand oblique forces, many of them firmly entrenched,
and from a logical point fully as defensible as were his own
peculiar conceptions.</p>

<p>&para; It was not, after all, what this man or that prince or some
other ruler thought, but what Bismarck thought, that turned
the balance.</p>

<p>A hundred instances could be offered to show that the men
Bismarck was fighting had the better part of the argument,
as mere argument; but between opinion and making that
opinion stick is a wide gulf&mdash;however logical may be the
argument.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck was for the ensuing twenty years pictured as a
noisy disturber, but he was shrewd, very shrewd. He could
call a man &#8220;liar,&#8221; &#8220;thief,&#8221; &#8220;scoundrel,&#8221; &#8220;impostor,&#8221; in virile
speechmaking, or could pass him up with a shrug, all the
while keeping a cold eye on the main chance, and in the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
getting his own way because he was strong enough to get
his way&mdash;and that is all the logic there is in the situation.</p>



<h5><a name="s31" id="s31"></a>31</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This miracle he did indeed perform; he turned back
the political clock to feudal days and gloriously set
up &#8220;Divine-right,&#8221; in the face of the intensely
modern cry, &#8220;Let the People Rule!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s amazing career affords a classical instance of
what a strong man can do, even against the very spirit of
his time!</p>

<p>So much the worse for that Zeitgeist! The jade had to come
to him, at last, completely subdued, as in the &#8220;Taming of the
Shrew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; As King&#8217;s Man, Bismarck now preached &#8220;Divine-right&#8221;
in an age of democratic ideas.</p>

<p>Thrones were falling everywhere; the inflammatory ideas
of the French Revolution had wrested from monarchs the
form, if not the substance, of constitutional liberties for the
masses.</p>

<p>The people were clamoring for they knew not what; at any
rate for some new experiment in the quest for happiness,
which they believed could be attained through new forms of
government. Bismarck fought the new order, and as late as
A.&nbsp;D. 1870, restated the seemingly worn-out doctrine of
&#8220;Divine-right.&#8221; How did he accomplish this political
miracle?</p>

<p>&para; A strong leader, by tireless repetition of some idea, finally
brings about faith in that idea. It does not follow that this
leader must necessarily be wiser than the masses. It is
always his will to power, rather than the inherent validity
of his ideas.</p>

<p>&para; First, he stands alone with his idea, whatever it may be.
Finally, one person is convinced? This is the beginning.
Well, if one, why not two, then ten, then a hundred, or a
thousand, or ten thousand?</p>

<p>&para; And so the wonder grows.</p>

<p>&para; At last, our stubborn man with the idea is believed! He now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
has his long-awaited day to prove the force of his contribution
to human welfare.</p>

<p>&para; There is a species of religious glamour over the old man&#8217;s
basic conception of respect for kings. The word king, for
Bismarck, spells faith in discipline, obedience, loyalty to
chosen leader&mdash;as against excesses sure to follow in turning
over the Government to the rabble, according to the
idea of the French Revolution. There is this condition to be
made here: that Bismarck undoubtedly leaned as far in one
direction as the old-line French Revolutionists did in another;
Bismarck was an extremist no less than Danton,
Marat, Robespierre. But there is also this distinction, in
Bismarck&#8217;s favor: He was a great constructive statesman
and the French agitators turned out to be but assassins and
political fools.</p>

<p>&para; We spare no one in this analysis, neither Bismarck nor
Robespierre. Therefore, we boldly, here and now, call your
attention to a certain strange fallacy in all political ideals.</p>

<p>&para; The people expect some new form, or change of government,
to make them happy and free. The machinery of
legislation is the thing. It is proclaimed the great leveler.</p>

<p>&para; Thus men eagerly try all manner of political enterprises,
believing that ultimately in some plan of government, social
equality will result. In the light of the anomaly that in
spite of our efforts, we persist in reverence for &#8220;the good
old&#8221; days, as against the iniquities of the moment, it is clear
that either we deceive ourselves, or are forever wandering
about in a fool&#8217;s paradise.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck at least does not justify cynical damnation. He
was intensely human, and so was the King of Prussia. It is
playing with race prejudice to call Prussia, after the French
fashion, &#8220;That robber Prussia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Nations act as do men individually, are swayed by forms
of pride, passion and prejudice. If every nation that robbed
or stole should return its loot of land, to whom would it ultimately
go?</p>

<p>&para; The United States would not, at least, now be in possession
of California. But for that matter, the Spaniards stole her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
from the Indians, and the Indians from the Aztecs, and the
Aztecs from we know not whom. Always then, history justifies
herself with the will to power&mdash;as manifested by the
strongest!</p>

<p>&para; Take it by and large, this miracle he did indeed perform:
He turned back the political clock of Time to Feudal days,
and gloriously set up &#8220;Divine-right,&#8221; in the face of the intensely
modern cry, &#8220;Let the people rule!&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Secret chamber in this strange man&#8217;s heart; the
master at work for United Germany.</p></div>

<p>&para; The great Bismarck, during his long and turbulent career,
as a rule refused to remain loyal to party affiliations.</p>

<p>The moment a party-theory no longer seemed expedient, the
Prussian Junker reckoned neither on political friendship nor
on political antipathy.</p>

<p>His whole life, he was engaged in endeavoring to persuade
others to adopt his policies, regardless of the fact that opposed
policies might be supported by as much if not even by
more logic. Bismarck always justified his opportunism by
saying that his sense of duty was superior to his private
feelings of love or hate; however, his attitude was uniformly
directed for or against conditions in proportion as, to his
mind, they were charged with good or evil for his beloved
Prussia.</p>

<p>Although one of the world&#8217;s greatest among amiable despots,
Bismarck always held himself to be at once free from prejudice
and under the hand of God. Even on this high ground,
it would still be easy to show (by many startling episodes in
Bismarck&#8217;s career) well-nigh innumerable changes of front
that, to the average mind, must pass as inconsistencies.</p>

<p>&para; Get clearly in mind, then, this giant&#8217;s political attitudes of
gross contradiction, as between promise and performance&mdash;otherwise
we will miss the essence of Bismarck&#8217;s genius as
a statesman and his peculiar glory as a man large enough
to stand beside C&aelig;sar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Now here is the master-key, unlocking every door in the
secret chambers of his heart: Bismarck, all his long life, kept
himself in power by his consummate knowledge of human
nature.</p>

<p>Shakespeare dealt with men, on paper, making them march
this way or that at the behest of his immortal genius.</p>

<p>Bismarck dealt with men in the open arena of life, had no
way of controlling their actions except by the inspiration of
his own practical, constructive genius.</p>

<p>It is one thing to control a man&#8217;s actions, on paper; wholly
another&mdash;and a greater triumph, is it not?&mdash;to master man&#8217;s
ways in the market place, making those around you do not
necessarily what they think they ought, but do what you
wish.</p>

<p>Thus in some senses Bismarck appears in the figure of the
superman; for there is absolutely no question that on many
occasions he forced strong men to do his bidding, squarely
against their individual preferences!</p>

<p>&para; This huge bulk, this deep-drinking, gluttonous Bismarck,
this world-defying voice, raged and stormed through his
eighty-three years of life&mdash;making little men&#8217;s souls shrink
in fear&mdash;and ever the essence of his genius was for alignments
with men, or against them, using this human clay ultimately
for his own peculiar ends, as the potter molds the
mud. He knew too that despite the old German family and
tribal feuds, the Germans are brothers; standing apart it is
true at this hour, fighting each other; yet the day is to come
when Bismarck will triumph in his Germany, one and united.
It mattered not, he would make friends with his deadly
enemy, if such a step seemed advisable to carry out that
cherished plan for a free and united Germany.</p>

<p>If he could not bend men to his will by logic, he tried flattery,
and if that failed he threatened war, and the war came,
too, but not till Bismarck was good and ready. He took his
own time, made preparations that defied disaster, then moved
forward and swept his enemies off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>&para; Thus, there was always evidences of peculiar precaution,
even in Bismarck&#8217;s boldest strokes. He never forgot himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
never did things by halves. It might take a week or a year,
or ten years, that mattered not to Bismarck; in the end, he
would bring his wishes to pass. He never courted failure
by hastening with some incomplete plan; but with the certainty
of Fate, Bismarck abided his time. Obliged to surmount
tremendous obstacles, often set back, in the end he
carried everything by force before him.</p>

<p>&para; We are here reminded of those vast fields of snow seemingly
in a state of dead rest, in the higher Alps, through
many winters still secretly gaining bulk and encroaching inch
by inch all unobserved upon the doomed valley below; then,
at the dropping of a mere pebble, the ice begins to slide,
nor does the dread avalanche pause for the sobs of the dying.
So behind Bismarck&#8217;s amazing preparedness his ofttimes
long deferred but inevitable destruction of his enemies seems
to be something that he borrows from the avalanche. It
is at once massive and inexorable, the power given to but
few master-spirits in the history of the world.</p>

<p>&para; In political acumen, in administrative and executive capacity
Bismarck measures up with C&aelig;sar. The smallest facts
about such as Bismarck are of more than ordinary interest.
Too much time cannot be spent on this great character, in
an endeavor to understand the secret springs of his mighty
powers.</p>

<p>Aside from the mere biographic outlines of his career, the
man presents, in himself, a study that deserves all the
thought that can be put on it&mdash;in an effort to set forth the
realism of his mighty life.</p>



<h5><a name="s33" id="s33"></a>33</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bismarck shows himself master at quelling a meeting,
checking a mob, stamping out a rebellion, and
heading off a king.</p></div>

<p>&para; And after the Frankfort radicals found themselves unable
to make Bismarck pick the German crown &#8220;out of the gutter,&#8221;
they turned and tried to establish&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;a
republic!</p>

<p>By Autumn, the forces of Revolution spent themselves and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Metternich drove the rebels before him, as the hurricane
blows chaff. Order was re-established in Vienna and in the
Italian states.</p>

<p>The uncompromising Metternich restored the &#8220;Old Diet,&#8221;
originally ordered by the Congress of Vienna, 1815, as the
one authentic source of political legitimacy for the clashing
German states. It was a clever Austrian by-play.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We now return to Berlin. In May, the blood-letting was
over, but no prospect of political reform seemed immediately
possible.</p>

<p>Bismarck began using what might be called underground
methods to head off the demand for that long-promised democratic
Constitution.</p>

<p>&para; Already the King began to see more clearly. It struck him
that this brazen-faced giant might be useful, later on. Had
not Bismarck said in his now widely quoted speech: &#8220;Soon
or late, the God who directs the battle will cast his iron
dice!&#8221; It gave His Majesty courage!</p>

<p>&para; The King looked to right and left, dissolved one Diet after
the other, till he had one to suit him. Otto nudged his King.
That momentary weakness of marching with the democrats
was something His Majesty wished to forget!</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s position must be clearly set forth. He was no
mere reactionary, brandishing his fists at new leaders, who
favored the common people. He knew all about this liberty,
equality and fraternity business, from across the Vosges&mdash;and
he despised the cure-all.</p>

<p>Here is the idea in a few words: Bismarck was not fighting
political liberalism, as an end; instead, he protested with his
giant&#8217;s strength at the implied destruction of the Old Regime.</p>

<p>&para; He laid the revolt largely to the bureaucratic system, which
he characterized as &#8220;The animal with the pen!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood fast by his good old Prussian dogma, as outlined
in &#8220;I am a Prussian!&#8221; paralleling &#8220;Rule Britannia,&#8221; and
other national hymns.</p>

<p>The song is sung with wild martial vigor, akin to the furious
appeal of ancient Polish melodies:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am a Prussian! see my colors gleaming&mdash;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Sixteen years later, when endeavoring with all his strength
to bring about German National unity, his &#8220;Prussians we are
and Prussians we will remain&#8221; was used against him with
mocking effect.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; By October, nerves were steadied. The King sent Gen.
Wangrel to occupy Berlin and disperse the radicals&mdash;with
cannon, if necessary.</p>

<p>That speech has the right sound; but William has before
this veered around many times, like a weather-vane, and may
he not shift again?</p>

<p>For the instant, he stood for the Old Regime and Divine-right.</p>

<p>&para; The following month William appointed Brandenberg, an
old-line Prussian aristocrat, Prime Minister. The siege of
Berlin was declared; the Assembly protested but finally gave
in. Along in December, without consulting the Assembly,
William invited the states to send delegates to Berlin and
made an alliance of three kings&mdash;Prussia, Saxony and Hanover.</p>

<p>&para; What is going to happen next?</p>



<h5><a name="s34" id="s34"></a>34</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At last the people have a share in their government,
but Bismarck sees to it that the radicals are
not favored.</p></div>

<p>&para; William&#8217;s &#8220;Tri-regal alliance&#8221; failed as fail it must on
account of jealousies. Then Wuertemberg replied with a
&#8220;quadruple&#8221; affair, composed of herself, Hanover, Bavaria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and Saxony, side by side, under a constitution acceptable to
Austria. Quite a stroke, that.</p>

<p>In turn, William set up his Erfurt parliament, March 20,
1850. Bismarck was fast becoming a &#8220;practical politician.&#8221;
Through deft stacking of the cards, the radical delegates
drew only the low cards, and the Kreuz-Zeitung crowd and
other ultra-conservatives were well supplied with aces and
kings.</p>

<p>Bismarck naturally urged more concessions to the Prussian
spirit; he tried also to muzzle the press gallery, calling
newspapers &#8220;fire-bellows of democracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later, he even started newspapers for his political purposes.
In this he was not inconsistent, merely logical; his attitude
was based on the fact that, at this particular time, he felt
called on to fight hostile editors; but made terms wherever
it seemed worth while. Such was the man&#8217;s discriminating
glance.</p>

<p>&para; The Erfurt &#8220;tongue tournament&#8221; Bismarck called the
whole affair. He did not oppose the King&#8217;s position in this
matter, because, as Bismarck said, &#8220;it makes no difference.&#8221;
He spoke contemptuously of the mystical high-flown
speeches. Its &#8220;Constitution&#8221; was quickly forgotten!</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s course would have been made somewhat easier
had he not openly refused to sit with President Simpson,
at the Erfurt convention, denouncing the President as &#8220;a
converted Jew!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The convention broke up, to meet again in Berlin, where
a Prussian Constitution was drawn up.</p>

<p>&para; Events moved rapidly. Austria now stood forth for resumption
of authority by the Old Diet, established by the
Congress of Vienna, while from Berlin one heard of a plan
for a &#8220;restricted union.&#8221;</p>

<p>Talk, talk, talk. Finally, in September, 1850, Austria invited
Prussia to a seat in the Old Diet. Prussia refused, and
the cat was out of the bag.</p>

<p>It meant that German Unity must come through Prussian
supremacy and Austrian humiliation&mdash;otherwise all might
well be forgotten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>But Austria was by no means so easily disposed of. There
was much life and fighting blood in her yet!</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s opinions during his years of preparation were,
on the whole, unchanging, though often presented in different
dress. In 1848, he bitterly objected to the King&#8217;s softness
in recalling his troops from Berlin, instead of definitely
crushing the March rebellions; in &#8217;49, he stood steadily beside
the King in refusing the people&#8217;s crown, from Frankfort; in
1850, he deplored the Prussian diplomatic defeat at Olmuetz,
but swallowed his mortification because he saw that Prussia
was not ready to strike; &#8220;and he thereon assisted in reconciling
his party to a policy which he deplored.&#8221;</p>

<p>This situation convinced Bismarck that the first duty of a
Prussian statesman is to strengthen the army, &#8220;that the
King&#8217;s opinions can be upheld at home; likewise backed by
the mailed fist, Prussian authority will be respected abroad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;My idea,&#8221; he says in his Memoirs, &#8220;was that we ought
to prepare for war, but at the same time to send an ultimatum
to Austria, either to accept our conditions in the
German question, or to look out for our attack.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Thus out of the Revolution of 1848, Prussia emerged with
a written Constitution, establishing a legislative assembly
and giving the people a share in their government.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s inconsistencies? Yes, by the score, but he was
playing a deep game of politics, for his King, and for his
beloved German Unity. Always, you must understand that
Bismarck scorned the political Millennium alleged to have
been brought in by the French Revolution; with the political
ideas from over the Vosges Bismarck would have nothing to
do. That old war-cry &#8220;the people&#8221; made him sick! He believed
in discipline and not in mob-rule. But he would not
rush unprepared into the war.</p>

<p>&para; It is a fact that, in 1850, Prussia had cause for war far
more just than that on which she seized in 1866. But Bismarck
made his famous anti-war speech!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Woe to the statesman who does not look about for a reason
for the war that will be valid, when the war is over!&#8221;
were his astonishing sentiments.</p>

<p>&para; What he really meant was that Prussia was not just then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
ready to fight; hence, he painted war as detestable; later
on, however, we shall see how he looks upon war, when
Prussia is ready!</p>

<p>&para; Prussia, through her political endorsement of the people
(1850) did not suddenly become a Parliamentary state, despite
William&#8217;s new Constitution. Broad privileges were
granted, but Prussia remained an absolute monarchy. While
there was henceforth to be a certain restricted cooperation
between Crown and Crowd, the Divine-right theory that had
come down through the ages was not weakened or its authority
compromised; in short, by conciliating certain hostile
popular elements, led by fire-breathing first-cousins of the
French Revolutionists, a large part of the hated Liberal programme
was done away with, in turn consolidating the
power of the Prussian kings.</p>

<p>&para; This situation also defines the political evolution essential
before Germany could become a Nation. Despite various
historians, Germany could not at this hour have proclaimed
herself a Republic.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck realized more and more, as he grew in experience
and power, that the Germans were sick unto death of political
experiments; they wanted unity, as a matter of course,
but by unity they really meant a head to the National house;
a strong father, to advise, protect and punish his children.
The parallel extends to the German idea of National rule;
thoroughness, efficiency, discipline take the place of political
expediency, job-holding for the mere sake of job-holding; in
church, in state and in family life the idea of a great central
Authority alone satisfies the German mind.</p>

<p>&para; Thus, the German conception of a Nation is intensely practical;
the state is not merely an aggregation of office-holders,
but the state is primarily a vast institution, efficiently administered
by the best minds, and these servants of the
people are instantly responsible to the great central authority,
whose power of removal for cause may be exercised as
the father corrects his children, for the good of the family.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; To these fundamental ideas, based on the soul of the German
people, Bismarck now addressed himself for many years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to come. He knew what the German race demands; his
analysis was psychologically correct, although few patriots
of &#8217;48 could see it that way.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; As his years of apprenticeship pass, Bismarck carries on
his mission in a new way: is decided to lead Prussia to the
conquest of Germany; is done with political platform-making
except in so far as the alignments of politics lend themselves
to his final purpose.</p>

<p>&para; With political instinct for gigantic projects carried out with
realism, the King&#8217;s Man now determined the bold outlines
of his National policy.</p>

<p>He did not worry about details: these he would fill in, as
time passed; but he would on one side hold fast to German
National unity and on the other side would sustain Prussian
kingcraft as the very voice of God for Germany; one of Bismarck&#8217;s
strongest ideas was that the King of Prussia was
the vicegerent of Christ on this earth. In short, Germany
must come through Prussian supremacy, and incidentally
exalt Prussian supremacy, otherwise it might not come at all.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; To clear William&#8217;s Divine-right once for all, so far as our
story goes, let it be known that German historians have
always laid stress on the respect of Teutonic tribesmen, from
ancient days, for the leadership of a strong fighting man.
Tacitus, the earliest writer of importance, detailing the lives
of Teutonic tribes, sets forth that it was the custom of
the German warriors in times of crises to select their strong
man and endow him with the power of rulership; looking to
him in turn to lead the tribe to war against the common
enemy. This reliance upon kings who were also powerful
war lords continuing through the centuries, satisfied the fundamental
aspirations of the Germans in their will to military
power; but as the generations passed the old story of human
nature was proved anew, that is to say, what begins as a
&#8220;privilege&#8221; ends as a &#8220;demanded right.&#8221; On the side of the
kings, was now proclaimed more loftily than ever that monarchy
is the voice of God.</p>

<p>&para; We come now to the year 1851.</p>

<p>&para; The entrance of Emperor Francis Joseph, at this time, on
the politico-military stage of Austria was followed by still
another era of political reaction; the Liberal Austrian constitution,
wrested during the riots, was revoked; as were
also those Democratic constitutions pledged for almost every
German state.</p>

<p>&para; The Germanic Confederation, with political legitimacy
vested in the curious Frankfort Parliament, again took the
field. It was an Austrian plan to get the advantage of
Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;If I do not do well, you can recall me,&#8221; Bismarck told
William. The King decided in his extremity to hazard the
appointment of the unknown Bismarck, as Prussian delegate
to Frankfort. William remembered those bold &#8220;White
Saloon&#8221; speeches.</p>

<p>&para; Now get this straight: Bismarck was a land-owner of
ancient days; estates won by the sword had been in the Bismarck
family for 600 years; nay, the Bismarcks traced their
knighthood to the far-distant year 1200. The force of this
appeal in the blood was at once profound and irresistible.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck to the day he died was always an Alt Mark vassal
to his liege lord and master, the Margrave of Brandenburg,
the King of Prussia. So much is clear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Bismarck was also much more than this. We repeat, he
was a leader of men. The King of Prussia could command
old families in scores if not in hundreds, to support the Ancient
Regime, socially and politically, but where find that
rare man, a born leader for the cause?</p>

<p>&para; Duty and self-interest prompted Bismarck to hold up the
royal hand, but after all is said, the vital force of Bismarck&#8217;s
endorsement was found in the man&#8217;s genius for leadership.
It was not so much the cause as it was the man. For had
Bismarck gone over to the other side the history of Germany
would have been vastly different.</p>

<p>&para; This Frankfort parliament, a hydra-headed political creation
dedicated to liberty, was in secret doing the purposes
of Austrian plutocracy and reaction; it was to be the last
stand of the Old Regime, against Democracy.</p>

<p>But it was necessary to move with cautious foot. The sappers
were at work under the thrones, and at any instant the
mines might be touched off.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck thus, quite by accident, finds himself the representative
of William IV, in Frankfort Diet or Bundestag, the
political Punch and Judy show originally set up by Metternich,
in 1815, to rule the quarreling thirty-nine German
states. Their intense individualism was such that Metternich,
who dominated at the Congress of Vienna, after the
downfall of Napoleon, did not know what was best.</p>

<p>All other parts of Europe, and even the islands of the seas
had been reassigned, but no human being could tell what
to do with the turbulent thirty-nine German states.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Here, then, was a mysterious &#8216;Court of Chance,&#8217; where
things dragged on for years, a political circumlocution office,
hopelessly bound by its own interminable seals, parchments
and red tape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The secret object was to do nothing that would not favor
Austria; with the idea that, in the end, the devious course
of politics would bring Austria final control of the German
lands, everywhere.</p>

<p>&para; It was in this absurd Parliament that Bismarck was to
perfect himself in political intrigue. Frankfort made no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
organic laws; these were mysteriously settled at Vienna; the
meetings of the Diet were held in secret; at best, the voting
was along lines that gave to Austria and not to Prussia the
deciding voice.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It did not take Bismarck long to find that at Frankfort
the King of Prussia was but a cipher. Furthermore, what
raised Bismarck&#8217;s ire was the impotence of the Parliament.
Frankfort had been unable to put down the blood-letting of
&#8217;48, and Bismarck detested weakness of any kind, mental,
physical or spiritual.</p>

<p>He was, and always remained, a profound extremist; but his
position was tempered by massive common sense.</p>

<p>&para; The world dearly loves a flunkey&mdash;and flunkeyism was universal
at Frankfort.</p>

<p>The many members fluttered about in gay military dress,
wore stars of sham authority, gold crosses, medals dangling
from bright ribbons.</p>

<p>Names prefixed by count, duke, margrave&mdash;crests on the
coach door and Latin mottoes&mdash;hyphenated family names,
indicated all manner of political marriages de convenience.
Bestarred gentlemen, one and all, if you please!</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck wrote home soon enough, for he was choking with
anger, not on account of the aristocratic airs of Frankfort
(for Bismarck dearly loved a title), but choking with anger
because his beloved King of Prussia was a Nobody in this
crazy Parliament. &#8220;I find them a drowsy, insipid set of
creatures, only endurable when I appear among them as so
much pepper,&#8221; are his sarcastic words.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Had Bismarck not been a diplomat, he might have made
his mark as a radical writer. His letters very often show
almost anarchistic dissent. At vulgar characterization, no
man could outsnarl Bismarck.</p>

<p>Also this Pomeranian giant&#8217;s correspondence at times fairly
stinks with frightful smells. When in these black moods,
he released nasty fumes around the heads of rivals.</p>

<p>We are surprised, likewise, to find growing in the mire of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
his thoughts, here and there, violets worthy of the poet
Freiligrath. The man&#8217;s power to be poetical or insulting, as
he willed, is indeed as strange as it is rare.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s pen pictures of fellow ambassadors&mdash;how they
flirted, danced, drank to excess, their maudlin ideas of government,
although regarding themselves as veritable political
seers&mdash;show the powerful satirical and analytical side of
Bismarck&#8217;s brain.</p>

<p>And although Bismarck mocked with sardonic immensity his
colleagues, yet with an under-play worthy of the Devil, our
Otto proceeded to make these owlish and absurd gentlemen
puppets in the hands of Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; Alas, time does not permit us to set forth the charming
letters Bismarck writes home. There is that moonlight swim
in the Danube; the interview with Metternich, the old war-horse
of kings; the gypsy ball and the weird fiddling
gypsies; his visits to robber-infested parts of Hungary, making
the trip in part in a peasant&#8217;s cart, &#8220;loaded pistols in the
straw at our feet, and near by a company of lanciers carrying
cocked carbines, against the imminent visits of robber
bands.&#8221;</p>

<p>He describes how he visited Ostend, going sea-bathing at
that famous resort; rambling on through Holland, smoking
a long clay pipe; then on to Sweden for the shooting;
next to Russia for wild boars.</p>

<p>&para; His letters often have a lyrical quality, telling of waterfalls
of the Pyrenees, the fascinating fairyland of Mendelssohn,
dark-eyed Spanish beauties, open-air concerts, London
garroters, old musty houses with peculiar smells, or what
you will. Bismarck dwells often on eating and drinking;
and in one letter from Paris speaks of a dinner at which he
drank St. Julien, Lafitte Branne, Mouton, Pichon, Larose,
Latour, Margaux, and Arneillac!</p>

<p>&para; These, and hundreds of other letters comprise charming
interludes between black moods of political intrigue, wherein
he used his vitriolic pen to lampoon his beribboned, bejeweled
farce-comedy fellow-ambassadors.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Germany is tied together with red tape,&#8221; writes Bismarck
at this stage of his political apprenticeship, at Frankfort;
and he hit the nail on the head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Promise yourself a delightful month reading Bismarck&#8217;s
four octavo volumes telling of his change of heart toward
Austria, as shown little by little in Frankfort dispatches,
documents and proceedings, interspersed with satirical
stories in Bismarck&#8217;s extremely individualistic style.
Throughout, you receive glimpses of the man&#8217;s great mind.
No less an authority than the Herr Prof. von Sybel tells us
of these Bismarck writings, bearing on the formation of the
German Empire: &#8220;They possess a classic worth, unsurpassed
by the best German prose writers of any age.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Applying Socratic methods to game of politics; Bismarck&#8217;s
bold and masterful preparations for German
unity.</p></div>

<p>&para; Now then, during these years 1851-&#8217;61, Bismarck was doing
two things: Perfecting himself in the dastardly art of political
intrigue; likewise, he was going about like a modern
Socrates, talking with men of high or low degree everywhere;
studying what might be called the human nature side of the
German problem of unity and nationality; studying it, not
in an aimless way, but to mould men to his own gigantic
political ends, when the right time arrived.</p>

<p>&para; Thus, with the stiff wind of adverse political affairs straight
in his teeth, remember that Bismarck&#8217;s great strength was
always his knowledge of men.</p>

<p>During the years of which we now write he made it his business
to visit the various petty German courts, to gaze on
princelings who would be kings; busied himself with court
gossip till he found out the inner political jealousies.</p>

<p>Thus fortified, Bismarck knew the one man or woman to
touch in the various parts of Germany, to help along Prussian
ambition&mdash;when the supreme moment to strike had come
at last.</p>

<p>&para; This supreme moment he awaited with diabolical patience
through the slow-going years.</p>

<p>No human being could hasten or retard Bismarck&#8217;s ultimate
victory; for he remained the one truly masterful man in
Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat at gambling tables, he wheedled secrets from the
prostitutes of princes; he stood by and egged on human dog-fights;
he took part in church-rows about doctrines; he had
inside glimpses of the venality of Austrian kept-press-writers,
&#8220;the scum of the earth,&#8221; he calls them, &#8220;who sell
opinions as the petty merchant sells butter and eggs.&#8221; Bismarck
seemed to be the only man in Europe who really was
able to grasp the solution of the German problem.</p>

<p>&para; Also, the granite soil of his heart is shown again and
again. What a hater he was!</p>

<p>For example, refusing to go to Mass for the repose of
Schwarzenberg&#8217;s soul, Bismarck gave the reason: &#8220;He is the
man who said: &#8216;I will abuse Prussia and then abolish her.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; You see, our Otto is one of those uncomfortable Germans
who in his own amazing personality expresses the National
ideal of earnestness; Otto is frightfully in earnest in his
cups, or over his half dozen eggs for breakfast&mdash;as you
please. He frightens timid souls.</p>

<p>&para; His temper few men could curb, much less sit calmly by
and receive without retiring in bad order. Incident after incident
at Frankfort might be cited, but what is the use?</p>

<p>&para; With fiendish earnestness Bismarck plotted to break the
bones of two democratic editors whose writings threw the
Prussian mastiff into periodical black rages. Bismarck justified
his cruelty by insisting that &#8220;bounds must be set for
these infamous press scribblings.&#8221; He means that attacks
on the Divine-right of kings must at all hazards be choked off.
He always hated journalists, called the press &#8220;a poisoned
well,&#8221; and as for himself he is on record to this effect: &#8220;I
always approached the ink-bottle with great caution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; But mark this well: Our Otto, in his turn, craftily used the
press to present the smooth side of his own political intriguing;
indeed he had his very valuable Prussian press bureau;
and we have authority for the statement that the Bismarckian
idea of journalism was to have &#8220;hireling scribes
well in hand, men who stabbed like masked assassins and
mined like mobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; During the decade we call Bismarck&#8217;s apprenticeship, 1851-&#8217;61,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
he was thus engaged: 1851, envoy at Frankfort Diet;
1852, Prussian ambassador at Vienna, during the illness of
Count Arnim; St. Petersburg, 1859; Paris, 1862.</p>

<p>Thus, he had an opportunity to get acquainted with all the
leading diplomatists on the European chessboard, to study
them in their own haunts, and to perfect himself in playing
with pitch without blackening his hands.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck told Francis Joseph, &#8220;I am firm to put an end
to the attacks on Prussia in the Austrian press!&#8221;</p>

<p>This boldness won the Emperor, and in confidence he remarked
to a friend: &#8220;Ah, that I had a man of Bismarck&#8217;s
audacity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Also, he told Joseph, &#8220;Prussia will never yield in the
matter of the commercial union, with Austria.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Emperor remarked on Bismarck&#8217;s youth&mdash;37 years&mdash;and
was much impressed. &#8220;Bismarck had the wisdom of a man
of 70!&#8221; was Joseph&#8217;s comment.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; You begin to get a clearer idea of what this thing called
patriotism means? Nay, do not scoff at our Otto; he is
only carrying on the old, old game called reaching out after
place and power; is doing exactly what you would do yourself,
if you had the will to rise to the mountain-tops where
live the Bismarcks and the C&aelig;sars.</p>

<p>Mask after mask Bismarck used to cover his real intent, from
1847 to 1870, the long years he was scheming to establish a
German Empire; and he did his work well; more than that
cannot be said of any man. Therefore, his fame is secure
in the Valhalla of Mankind.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Here is an amusing bit, showing the craft and cunning of
our master: When Napoleon the Little, through his coup
d&#8217;etat made himself Emperor of France, December 2, 1851,
and while Frankfort&#8217;s Parliament was trying to decide
&#8220;what&#8221; to say about it, officially, a French journal in Frankfort
printed an enthusiastic endorsement of the new
Emperor.</p>

<p>Bismarck suspected that it came straight from Prussia&#8217;s
hated rival. Seeking out the proprietor of the newspaper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Bismarck congratulated him &#8220;on close relations with Napoleon.&#8221;
The owner, taken off his guard, replied: &#8220;You are
wrong; it came from Vienna!&#8221; This was exactly what Bismarck
wished to ascertain, and his suspicions were verified.</p>

<p>To make assurance doubly sure, Bismarck leaving the journalist,
did a little detective work. In the garden, from a
secret place, he could see the French minister&#8217;s house. In
half an hour, he spied the journalist ringing the French
minister&#8217;s doorbell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ha!&#8221; was Bismarck&#8217;s comment.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; What did this giant not do to help his beloved Prussia, and
to humiliate his detested Austria?</p>

<p>One day, he found a fiery anti-Prussian review in an Austrian
member&#8217;s desk. He thought nothing of ransacking a
desk. Richelieu had a system of espionage unrivaled in
history. Bismarck in this respect is the Cardinal&#8217;s close
second. Each man regarded himself as a patriot. Bismarck
was obstinately loyal to Prussia. Her aggrandizement became
henceforth his life&#8217;s passion. Nay, Bismarck did not
ask that the member be dismissed! That would be punishment
too coarse. Instead, Bismarck decided that the best revenge
would be to print the address piecemeal and thus keep
the member in suspense;&mdash;something like twisting the cords
a little each day till the victim meets strangulation in frightful
form.</p>

<p>&para; During the eight years that Bismarck was a member of
the freakish Frankfort Diet set up by Austria to &#8220;rule&#8221; the
quarreling thirty-nine German states, Bismarck, the Prussian
giant, came to see the necessity of controlling the press.</p>

<p>&para; Frankfort stupidities decided Bismarck to appeal directly
to the common people (whom also he politically despised!)
and hence we find that he now meets Austria&#8217;s hired journalists
by urging the utmost press-freedom. &#8220;In this,&#8221; says
Lowe, &#8220;Bismarck was an opportunist,&#8221; as he often was. &#8220;I
learned something,&#8221; he used to say when his enemies accused
him of shifting ground.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck now demanded &#8220;open discussion&#8221; of German policies;
saw that hired press agents vigorously set forth the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Prussian side. In this connection it is interesting to draw a
parallel between Bismarck&#8217;s ideas of journalism, in 1852,
and the American conception (1915).</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;In the press, truth will not come to light through the
mists conjured into life by the mendacity of subsidized newspapers,
until the material wherewith to oppose all the mysteries
of the Bund (Frankfort) shall be supplied to the Prussian
press, with unrestricted liberty to use it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; This idea is precisely what extremists like Roosevelt set up
(1915), battling against &#8220;trusts,&#8221; endeavoring to make them
audit their books on the curbstone! So, what is new under
the sun?</p>



<h5><a name="s37" id="s37"></a>37</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ox-like patience of Prussian peasantry sorely tried&mdash;The
incessant call for the strong man to end political
miseries.</p></div>

<p>&para; As the result of all this deep study, Bismarck came to the
conclusion that Prussia in the great moral idea of a United
Germany could win, only by fighting Austria. We might as
well get at the core of this thing, in short order. The complications
are amazing; but the more we probe into Bismarck&#8217;s
gigantic problem, the larger grows the stature of
our modern German giant.</p>

<p>&para; From this time till the hour of his death, many years later,
Bismarck remains the one great central will power of Germany,
the source of political legitimacy, dealing out with his
brawny hands favors where they would do the most good,
setting men up or casting them down; and in the end,
through a series of profound political combinations the inner
currents of which to this hour no human being has been able
to chart and classify, our strong man at last is to set up his
United Germany, placing the imperial crown on William&#8217;s
head in the palace of the French kings, at Versailles.</p>

<p>&para; Oh, how unforgivable all this is to the French. Not only
that defeat should come in &#8217;70, but that the palace of the
Bourbons, costing some $200,000,000, should be used in solemn
mockery by the super-man Bismarck, as the stage-setting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
whereby to complete the imperial German holiday! Centuries
must pass before this, the profound mortification to French
feelings, is forgotten. That is to say, the worst thing you
can do to a man is to hurt his pride. Had the German Empire
come to pass without wounding French pride (not
to add the French pocketbook) the French would long since
have gone on their way in peace, rejoicing in German prosperity.
Why not? The French are Christians, not the slightest
doubt of that; and as Christians do not envy the German
ox, ass or maid-servant. Indeed, that is as it should be in a
Christian world.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; At home, up in Prussia, Bismarck&#8217;s sullen glances surveyed
Europe afar, and in the &#8217;50&#8217;s, of which we are writing, this
is his problem:</p>

<p>He sees Germany still a mere crazy-quilt of clashing states.
There are warring ecclesiastical barons, free cities, petty
princelings; Catholic Bavaria against Protestant Prussia;
nobles against the people; the people against themselves,
divided by God knows what controversies, sane or insane;
poets writing their hymns of liberty then dying unheroically
by a brickbat flung wildly in some street brawl; jurists trying
to hammer together some constitution that will not be blown
to pieces by the first explosion of gunpowder;&mdash;and all failing!
With pugnacious Prussia on the North, with rapacious
Austria on the South, with insolent Bavaria hanging off on
the Southwest, and the others fighting tooth and nail for the
land, that will eventually fall to the strongest&mdash;the German
problem became an exhibition over many years of the noblest,
likewise of the darkest, passions of the human breast.</p>

<p>Three dreadful wars were to be fought, 80,000 lives were to
be sacrificed, during twenty years of turbulence; and in the
blood-drenched interim various monarchs are to make a plaything
of the thirty-nine disunited German states.</p>

<p>&para; But the thing had to be gone through with. The historical
evolution could not be hastened, although it was often set
back. Sick Germany had many a hideous nightmare before
the fever passed.</p>

<p>Convention after convention, diet after diet, contending monarchs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
using any plea that will give the upper hand to Prussia
or to Austria, or over princes and whimsical knights,
from the one who holds his sovereignty because his ancestor
had been a king&#8217;s barber, to another who in a lucky moment
had found the queen&#8217;s lace handkerchief, and after that
lived like a parasite on the land;&mdash;all these high contracting
parties must be sent to the dump heap and the soil sprinkled
with precious German brothers&#8217; blood, mingling freely with
vile blood, before the new political crop can grow.</p>

<p>&para; Between 1750 and 1870 the German problem had been settled
over and over again, but was not finally settled till by
Bismarck&#8217;s blood and iron. This means in Frederick the
Great&#8217;s own obstinate way!</p>

<p>&para; We have heard from political fanatics, poets, lawyers,
kings, thieves, church-people; all manner of men and not a
few women have babbled and cackled; and there has been
blood-letting, generation after generation, all up and down
the Rhine, the Main, the Spree and the Elbe; then there
would follow a lull brought about by some great Charter of
Liberty framed by the Liberals, at their latest conference;
and when it all went up in smoke, we would hear again that
the Prussian government had its own plan, which, quite
naturally Austria would never consent to advance.</p>

<p>&para; Indeed, the ox-like patience of the German people, with
their great moral dream of &#8220;German National faith,&#8221; was
strongly tried.</p>

<p>&para; It remained for the obstinate spirit of Frederick, through
Bismarck, to find the only way, by blood and iron. Sentimentalists
should not shed tears. It is no less an authority
than Marshal Davout, the great French soldier who had for
his watchword, &#8220;The world belongs to the obstinate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was not the Great Frederick, in his youth, an idealist, and
did he not write a touching essay on the evils of absolutism?
But he ended by embracing the tyranny of kings&mdash;even as
you and I, if we have the power.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; At the very outset, then, let it be made clear that it is
short-sighted to call Bismarck Prussian tyrant. What would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
you, please? Cakes for the child, when the child cries? That
has often been tried, and always in vain.</p>

<p>Next time, the child wants two cakes instead of one. It will
not do.</p>

<p>Frederick was dubbed the &#8220;last of the tyrants.&#8221; We are sorry
if this were true.</p>

<p>Tyrants are exceedingly useful. Nay, we are glad to report
that Frederick is not the last.</p>

<p>They still exist in every family, village, city, state, and
nation.</p>

<p>For the most part, they exercise their tyranny in petty exactions,
with no big plan such as distinguishes the dominating
man from the little fellow with the mean temper and his
childish ambition to rule, let us say, his dog or his wife.</p>

<p>&para; There is something pathetic in the incessant call this earth
has for a strong man. It was so in Germany, and Bismarck
was that man.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar was assassinated because he was said to be a tyrant,
yet after his death for 400 years Rome sought in vain for a
man strong enough to hold the Empire from going to pieces.</p>

<p>&para; Is there not something puzzling in the devotion of a people
to their amiable oppressor? They may rebel against absolutism,
as Bavarian hates Prussian, but if the political despot
is strong enough to win against foreign foes, as Bismarck
did at Koeniggraetz, Sedan and Gravelotte, the people kiss
the hand that smites. What greater tests of loyalty do you
ask of human nature?</p>

<p>&para; Before 1866, he was without doubt the &#8220;best-hated&#8221; man in
Europe, lampooned, ridiculed, even the victim of attempted
assassinations.</p>

<p>At Frankfort mothers sang their children to sleep by the
following ditty:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sleep, darling, sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be always gentle and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Vogel von Falkenstein will come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carry you away in a sack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bismarck too will come after him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he eats up little children.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></div></div>

<p>&para; Yet within a few years, in his character as Prussian Prime
Minister, who against the will of the people achieved the
greatness of Prussia, and thereby made possible United Germany,
no adulation was too great for our self-same Bismarck,
formerly sneered at, despised, vilified, and stoned.</p>

<p>So much for the value of public opinion. What then does it
all mean?</p>

<p>Bismarck made his 30-years&#8217; battle against the people and
won; and the people, strange to say, turned a mental somersault
and now saw no inconsistency in cheering Bismarck,
as liberator.</p>

<p>&para; How strange this sounds!</p>



<h5><a name="s38" id="s38"></a>38</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here is the Man of the Hour, depicted in all his
naked realism.</p></div>

<p>&para; This amazing German problem called for a wise despot,
to confront and overawe weak men, gathered in German parliaments
in which there were worlds of cackling, but no
wisdom.</p>

<p>The curse of Germany had been too much speechmaking, too
much poetry, too much dreaming. The babble went on from
1815 to 1866, at least&mdash;fifty years!</p>

<p>&para; The times called for a hard-headed, dogmatic, tyrannical
man with a plan large enough to subdue the thirty-nine warring
parts, and weld the whole into a mighty Empire.</p>

<p>This meant a tyrant of the massive Frederick the Great type.
It called for a man erect and proud, keen of speech, with
absolute self-confidence, who in a pinch was master at underhand
dealing, and who could deliberately use harshness and
malice.</p>

<p>The man had to understand the delicate art of flattery, and
at other times be blustering and outspoken.</p>

<p>The roar of cannon should make him as cold as ice, but underneath
his frozen exterior he should have a fiery nature,
full of craft and guile, like a Gascon.</p>

<p>He should have a torrent of cutting words, his eyes should
flash and his blood should boil, yet he should be able to wage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a secret war, masked under compliments, or draw his dagger
and strike for the heart.</p>

<p>He should have thousands of enemies and prevail over
them all.</p>

<p>He should have boundless ambition; action should be the zest
of his life, and at crucial times he should display an uncontrollable
temper.</p>

<p>He should seek the path of glory; a man of fiery enthusiasm,
who never forgives an enemy; has fits of rage; is jealous;
a great swordsman, fights duels; a master horseman, able
to ride day and night without fatigue.</p>

<p>He should be at once cautious and headlong, realizing that
in the end it is the bold play that wins. He should be able
to live down public utterances that would cause other men
years of disgrace. He should be able to quell a mutiny, check
a mob or stamp out a rebellion. And, above all, whether admired
or detested, he should justify his career by succeeding
in what he started to do.</p>

<p>&para; In other words, he must be Bismarck, the greatest empire-builder
since C&aelig;sar&#8217;s day&mdash;yes, not even barring Napoleon,
for Napoleon&#8217;s empire crumbled to dust, yet Bismarck&#8217;s, fresh
with youth, still lives on!</p>

<h3>The Mailed Fist</h3>


<h5><a name="s39" id="s39"></a>39</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Supporting Bismarck&#8217;s idea of the mailed fist; Democracy
stems from and is supported by aristocracy.</p></div>

<p>&para; Why is it that, in the American Republic, there is aversion
to acknowledging the services of men sprung from aristocracy,
like Bismarck? Are the facts unrecognized, or is the
silence only another form of political quackery?</p>

<p>&para; To bring the matter home, let us ask, &#8220;How is it in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
United States?&#8221; Washington was an aristocrat of fortune,
one of the richest men of his time, dispassionate, cold, aloof;
Hamilton, an aristocrat of breeding, contributing his quota
to democracy, as he saw it; Lafayette, an aristocrat of birth,
helped us gain our liberty; and certainly Jefferson, an aristocrat
of intellect as well as of fortune, the owner of 185
slaves, and the gifted author of the Declaration of Independence,
offered inestimable services to the common people.</p>

<p>&para; Off-hand, the average biographer records this: &#8220;Bismarck
had no confidence in the common people. He fought a written
Constitution. He did not wish to see his King yield an
inch to the masses. It was the Crown against the Crowd.
Violently reactionary, he blocked progress&mdash;for there can be
no progress without change. He was trying to force the
stream of time backward, instead of going with the tide.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; An American who for the first time follows the history of
the Unifier of Germany begins very early in the investigation
to have a feeling of apprehension. He is sure that Bismarck
is a reactionary; his ideas are so out of &#8220;harmony&#8221; with the
spirit of the times, the air full of the &#8220;liberty, equality and
fraternity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bismarck&#8217;s attempt to sustain the monarchial system, especially
the idiotic conception of &#8220;Divine-right&#8221; of kings, as
against the rising tide of &#8220;confidence in the people,&#8221; has
about as much chance for success as that the slavery system
could be re-introduced into the United States, after that question
had been settled by five years&#8217; war. Thus you conclude,
from the American view!</p>

<p>&para; As you read on and on, you feel that on the very next page,
Bismarck will surely go to the scaffold, or will fall by the
dagger of some &#8220;friend of the people,&#8221; a thug ever after regarded
as the veritable Savior of his country for the assassination
of the enemy of the common people.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The much ridiculed &#8220;Divine-right&#8221; of kings is cognizable
as a right based on the survival of the fittest, backed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
sword; filled with human weaknesses and shortcomings, but
defensible as a system, withal; just as the real intent of the
words &#8220;captain of industry&#8221; should mean one whose fatherly
care over his laborers, his judgment, his risk of capital, his
foresight in weathering bad times&mdash;redounds to the immediate
prosperity of the workers with whom he can have no
quarrel.</p>

<p>&para; To those who make light of Bismarck&#8217;s theory of blood and
iron, in government, it should be pointed out that all governments
that endure, regardless of what theory you may work
under, in the end fall to the strongest;&mdash;just as in a family
fight the estate goes to the strongest, or in a partnership
fight, or in religion, science, social affairs, love or war, the
strong man has his way over the weak; and it is still to be
proven that the American democracy, which at best is only
another of manifold experiments in self-government, is to
survive as long as have in the past royalist ideas&mdash;already
that have persisted for thousands of years.</p>

<p>&para; So, we have invented Democracy out of a thousand costly
expenditures of blood and treasure. We protest that this
latest experiment in government is to endure forever more,
but not one man in a thousand has any real conception of the
Democracy in which all men shall work for a common National
end.</p>

<p>Thus, Democracy is fully as large an experiment as any
other in the Halls of Time; and today we are still nursing
childish ideals, attempting to level men by legislation, and
incidentally taking satisfaction in stoning our public servants,
decrying wealth, and robbing the individual of any
broad conception of responsibility.</p>



<h5><a name="s40" id="s40"></a>40</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Parallel elements that make for power in America
and Germany.</p></div>

<p>&para; It is difficult for a certain type of American mind to get
Bismarck&#8217;s point of view. This is because of the failure to
recognize that in whatever respect Absolutism and Republicanism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
may differ, as forms of government, the fact remains
that it is society, and not human nature, that has
been transformed. The old motives, ambition, love, war,
marriage, pride, prejudice, still sum up underlying conditions,
however firmly any government may seem to be established,
called by whatever name, and led by Crown or Crowd.
In addition, all history forecasts the ultimate ruin of any
r&eacute;gime founded on human nature.</p>

<p>&para; As between the share which belongs to each man, and the
share which does not belong to him but to the body politic,
expressed in a reciprocal concession, upon each side, for the
good of the state&mdash;that dream of governmental idealism has
never yet been attained, even in free America, to say nothing
of Germany, France, England or Russia, and men will continue
to annex the spoils to their private estates as long as
men are what they are, at heart.</p>

<p>&para; The elements that make for a desire to grasp power, in
free America, are essentially the same, though in a different
dress, as they were in Prussia, in Bismarck&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>We are wont to dismiss this matter with a shrug and charge
all the turmoil up to a senseless desire on the part of the
King of Prussia to force, for his own aggrandizement, his
rule on an unwilling people, and we therefore call Bismarck
a tyrant, as though in this conclusion we thus elevated our
own virtues by a shuddering &#8220;May-God-forbid!&#8221; sort of recognition
of Bismarck&#8217;s political vices.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The old man had a grand idea just the same; he devoted
his life to building up a free and united Germany. His intense
belief in German virtues made his task sacred. He met
the desire for a National cause and for greater freedom. He
had to carry men by storm.</p>

<p>&para; However offensive, politically speaking, may seem in democratic
America Prussia&#8217;s &#8220;Divine-right&#8221; theory, it is a fact
that we, also, appeal to the god of battles just as Bismarck
did. We open our Congress with prayers often couched in
conceited belief that God is on our side; while our historians
have repeatedly dwelt on the fact that America has a &#8220;manifest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
destiny,&#8221; a phrase reiterated by editors the land over
till it has sunk deep into the public conscience. Therefore,
in democratic America, we avow that we are in the hands
of the Lord; an idea secretly nourished by millions of Americans
who would publicly deny that any such Feudal conception
as Divine-right of kings could possibly exist in related
form, in the United States.</p>

<p>Surely we cannot mean that Divinity has anything to do
with the majorities in an American election?</p>

<p>&para; Then this &#8220;manifest destiny&#8221; must refer to the ultimate
fact that, however we may blunder along, in times of crisis
the Lord comes forth, to lead us out of the wilderness.</p>

<p>It is a familiar line of thought to find Grant, Sherman, and
Lincoln and others, deified in the American press, as men
&#8220;miraculously risen&#8221; in storm and stress to preserve the
&#8220;manifest destiny&#8221; of our Nation.</p>

<p>If there be any logical distinction between this hope on the
part of millions of loyal Americans, expressing their patriotism
in terms of Heaven&#8217;s protective policy, and the attitude
of Bismarck in regard to his King, as ordained of God, to
rule over the Prussian people, then it would require a high-power
microscope to detect any essential variation.</p>

<p>&para; Meantime, we go on building dreadnaughts and inscribe on
our coins, &#8220;In God We Trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>King William in Bismarck&#8217;s day refused the people&#8217;s paper
crown of the Frankfort assembly, but plotted to have one
offered to him by the princes of Germany. Was he, logically,
any more inconsistent than is our own &#8220;manifest destiny&#8221;
conception of America?</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; For it is ever the way with strong men to believe themselves
the Lord&#8217;s anointed, likewise with strong nations&mdash;and
democratic America is no exception.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chinese&#8221; Gordon carried with him wood of the real Cross,
as he believed, and read his Bible day by day, up to the last,
confident that he was in the charge of some unseen power
for good, as against the destroying African tribes around
Khartum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry M. Stanley&#8217;s books are honeycombed with appeals to
God as his guide and protector; he believed that God was
with him in &#8220;Darkest Africa,&#8221; would see him through at the
price of how many negro murders it mattered not, warding
off fever, discouragement, starvation, and standing ever on
the white man&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>In America, where the &#8220;Divine-right&#8221; of kings is a subject
of political ridicule, it is a fact that in the courts we raise
our right hand and swear to tell the whole truth; our marriage
ceremonies are consecrated; and the last word at the
grave is that God is our refuge; we have our chaplains who
speak of God on our battleships, and in our armies; in the
Autumn the President of the United States invokes a blessing
for bountiful crops, and returns the Nation&#8217;s thanks to
God for these favors.</p>

<p>&para; All this is no more illogical than that Bismarck should
insist that the Hohenzollerns, his masters, obtained their
right to rule as a direct dispensation from high heaven, as
against the Hapsburgs, who were Prussia&#8217;s rivals. Bismarck
preached his theological-political dogma with intense earnestness
during his long life; and at last the people must have
been impressed with his arguments&mdash;or was it that he forced
them to his way of thinking?</p>

<p>&para; Along about 1857, our poor William IV lost his mind; for
four years he continued a nervous wreck; his brother, William
I, was the sick man&#8217;s representative as Prussian king;
and in &#8217;61, when William IV died, William I became sovereign
ruler of pugnacious Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; The common people welcomed William I with open arms,
that is to say, adoring a fighting man, and long disappointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
by the timidity and vacillation of kind-hearted William IV,
with his church-building plans and his Jerusalem bishoprics,
it seemed as though the reactionary character of Prussian
political life might now come to an end.</p>

<p>Frederick&#8217;s many-sidedness was in sharp contrast to William&#8217;s
one-sidedness; Frederick&#8217;s unfixed decision is now expressed
by William&#8217;s unvarying will. Where Frederick had
been brilliant and imaginative, William was cold and solid.</p>

<p>&para; William was now over sixty, at which age men&#8217;s lives, as
a rule, are in eclipse.</p>

<p>Yet this man of destiny had still in store the making of a
modern C&aelig;sar. He was to become king of kings, ruler of
an empire whose individual units were commanded not by
democrats trying new ambitions; but instead, many monarchs
were to proclaim, &#8220;William, Emperor of United Germany!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; This son of Queen Louise, mother of Prussia, was now to
justify the sacrifices of the great German foster-mother;
for as she had labored with Scharnhorst to perfect the Prussian
military, and in the hour of Prussia&#8217;s extremity dared
to confront even the great Napoleon himself, likewise her
son William was now to complete, years later, the mother&#8217;s
ideals.</p>

<p>Where she scattered seed on fallow ground, the son was to
reap his abundant harvest of Prussian glory.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Whoever wishes to rule Germany must conquer it; and
that cannot be done with phrases,&#8221; wrote William, 22 years
before he was crowned at Versailles.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We have seen all manner of Hohenzollerns&mdash;robber-knight
Hohenzollerns&mdash;landscape-gardening Hohenzollerns&mdash;church-building
Hohenzollerns&mdash;and Hohenzollerns tied to a woman&#8217;s
apron string.</p>

<p>A brave, practical, common-sense Hohenzollern is now head
of the distinguished Prussian house.</p>

<p>William I is flatly opposed to Liberalism, but is shrewd
enough to have a moderate Liberal among his kingly advisers;
for William realizes the political weakness of further
constitution-tinkering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Finally, we have before us a man as obstinate as Bismarck,
but without Bismarck&#8217;s creative imagination; a Prussian
King reared in the army, who loved the army, who understood
the army;&mdash;even as Bismarck understood political intrigue.
The combination was unique!</p>

<p>Also, we have here a William of enormous ambition, little
suspected under his rather conventional innocent-appearing
German mask.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We come now to a place where furious political torrents
begin beating down the ancestral forests of Germany; torn
by flashes of lightning and the ominous roll of thunders, the
air is filled with broken boughs, flying leaves and clouds of
dust.</p>

<p>Bismarck, god of thunder, rides upon the furious storm.</p>

<p>Let us closely follow the general track of the hurricane now
raging in Prussia, more especially in the Prussian Chamber.</p>

<p>&para; In &#8217;59, William had appointed von Roon Minister of War;
the people objected, declaring it another evidence of William&#8217;s
reactionary principles. The plan was to increase the
army from 130,000 in peace and 215,000 in war to 190,000 in
peace and 450,000 in war.</p>

<p>It really meant universal military service for Prussia, with
63,000 recruits each year, practically doubling the service,
making it possible within a decade to call possibly 1,200,000
soldiers!</p>

<p>&para; The Chamber of Deputies opposed the plan, vigorously.
However, the Chamber in a patriotic moment had voted army
money on condition that the increase was only incidental,
but William while saying little of his plans acted as though
his army appropriations were to be permanent, henceforth.</p>

<p>&para; Over this question, a bitter controversy! The King took
the ground that it was the duty of the Deputies to raise the
cash in such sums as were required for state purposes&mdash;whatever
these might be, in the opinion of the King.</p>

<p>It was conceded that, in military matters, William&#8217;s judgment
was good, but the Liberals did not much like these great
military expenses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>William even thought of breaking the deadlock by abolishing
parliament and ruling alone, or abdicating his throne!</p>

<p>He had already written out his abdication, so the story goes,
and it was lying on his desk, all signed, awaiting the moment
of proclamation.</p>

<p>&para; At the eleventh hour, William bethought himself of an
invincible fighting man, Otto von Bismarck, widely known for
boldness and independence.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I am willing to carry out your policy, whether Parliament
is agreed or not! I will rather perish with my King than
forsake Your Majesty in the contest with Parliamentary
government!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; And William tore up the abdication paper and replied,
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get down to business!&#8221;</p>



<h5><a name="s42" id="s42"></a>42</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The four years&#8217; conflict era&mdash;Here Bismarck is at
last revealed in his true character&mdash;King&#8217;s Man supreme!</p></div>

<p>&para; Ten years of rough-and-tumble fighting in the blind alleys
of political intrigue have now prepared Otto von Bismarck
for great things. In the solemn years to come, all is yet to
be dignified by the formation of an Empire, through blood
and iron.</p>

<p>&para; The King&#8217;s ambition grew on what it fed upon&mdash;a desire
for Prussian aggrandizement, at all hazards, and the ultimate
solution of the German problem through Prussian
power of arms. He made up his mind, accordingly, that he
ought to reorganize the army; for this purpose he had asked
the Chamber for 12,000,000 thalers.</p>

<p>The cat slipped out of the bag, in spite of precautions. This
12,000,000 thalers was to be used to buy needle-guns and
powder, in the oncoming War of the Brothers.</p>

<p>&para; Our William I, whatever he might be, was at least no
namby-pamby sentimentalist. That honest German face,
those kindly blue eyes, his high complexion, made him look
as guileless as a happy school boy; but he had his deep desire
for place and power, side by side with Bismarck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; It was a most fortunate day for this hard-headed unimaginative
William that Otto von Bismarck, in the Autumn of
1862, accepted the Portfolio of Prussian Minister. William
wanted a strong man to fight the hostile radical deputies for
that 12,000,000 thalers, for the war-chest.</p>

<p>There is no use casting about for fair words to butter parsnips.
The long-deferred irrepressible War of the Brothers
was determined upon; and the Prussian dynasty was to wade
through seas of blood to the heights of glory; and the purpose
was ever to end this age-old German family strife.</p>

<p>&para; William I is deservedly a great German national hero. He
is the true father of his country.</p>

<p>&para; We see nothing to criticise. The situation is very human;
and the leading actors play their difficult parts with discrimination.
In your own life&#8217;s conquests, do you do any
more, and often do you not do less? Is it not true in your
own life that you have to fight for what you achieve? Truly,
the world belongs to him who seizes it. William knew this;
Bismarck certainly knew it; and in this respect the two great
men were agreed. So far, good. In broad outline the plan
was to make the Prussian dynastic government rule over
territorial United Germany; but it must come with the consent
of the rulers of the independent German states and not
through decrees of people&#8217;s parliaments or the howlings of
mobs.</p>

<p>&para; As for Bismarck, he was the one man of the hour for black
situations. His schooling in human nature had progressed
amazingly. For the past ten years, at Frankfort, at St.
Petersburg, at Paris, at Vienna, Bismarck had fallen afoul
of all leading political strategists of Europe, men gloating
over the problem of annexing to their private estates the
divided German thirty-nine states: Bismarck had studied the
individual line of battle of Frenchman, Russian, Italian,
Dane, Briton, to say nothing of the ambitions of princelings,
counts, deputies, margraves, prelates, poets, and political
hen-coop makers;&mdash;knew too, how at the critical moment to
block their individual games and just when to give his own
deadly knockout&mdash;either above or below the belt!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; During his period of preparation, as we have seen, for
twenty years Bismarck had consistently preached &#8220;Divine-right,&#8221;
stood for what he called &#8220;Christian monarchy.&#8221;</p>

<p>For years, also, it appeared that the thing was for Prussia
to enter into a close political union with Austria, but now
Bismarck was convinced that he must fight Austria. Fight
or shake hands were the same to the giant Otto; the thing
was to win, if not in one way then in another! Otto, after
his Frankfort experiences saw clearly Austria&#8217;s under-play
to dominate the political situation; and in turn felt himself
called upon to check Austrian ambition in favor of his liege
lord, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; Finally, Bismarck&#8217;s great chance came. William asked
Bismarck to force the army bill.</p>

<p>Now indeed will the giant rage, snapping his teeth in the
face of the hurricane,&mdash;yes, four long years he is to rule
without color of law.</p>



<h5><a name="s43" id="s43"></a>43</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On comes the storm&mdash;Not by speechmaking but by
blood and iron are the great questions to be decided,
says Bismarck!</p></div>

<p>&para; At least, we admit that William I was a thoroughbred
Hohenzollern in innate admiration of the iron fist!</p>

<p>Now this was the situation: The secret war-chest against
Austria had to be filled in one way or another; but the difficulty
was found in the fact that the common people, acting
under a mysterious instinct not to be explained but very real
withal, had already begun to show unrest about an approaching
War of the Brothers, as the sentimentalists called the
irrepressible conflict between Austria and Prussia. The upshot
was that Bismarck&#8217;s political secrets while not definitely
understood in detail, were quite generally divined by
close students of the German problem. The Liberals were
intent on their own interests, in Prussia, and believed that
their political solution depended on hampering the King, regardless
of his cause. Hence the Liberal deputies of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Chamber spunkily stood out against William&#8217;s heavy demands
for cannon and gunpowder.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck, as King&#8217;s Minister, had to face the political
storm. He did not dare to say that he wanted the money
for war; he wanted the money&mdash;was not that enough?</p>

<p>Thereupon, Bismarck proceeded to domineer over the delegates.</p>

<p>The Chamber was willing to do something, but how about
the rumor that these huge appropriations are to be hereafter
a permanent item in the budget? Bismarck would not make
the delegates&#8217; minds easy; he wanted money, much money,
12,000,000 thalers in fact, for the army&mdash;and the least the
delegates could do was to vote the funds. If they did not
give the cash gracefully, why he would coerce the deputies&mdash;that
was all!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;It is not by speechifying and majorities,&#8221; he thundered,
&#8220;that the great questions of the time will be decided&mdash;that
was the great mistake in &#8217;48 and in &#8217;49,&mdash;BUT BY BLOOD
AND IRON.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Members of the Chamber shrank in horror.</p>

<p>There were extremely powerful and learned men there, to
combat Bismarck&#8217;s point of view, and our political conspirator
on his emperor-hunt had to listen to some of the most
merciless rebukes he was ever to hear, during his long and
highly exciting career. But he took them all, without a
whimper.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;We have too many Catalines existing among us that have
an interest in social uprisings,&#8221; Bismarck thundered. &#8220;Germany
considers not the Liberalists of Prussia, but her own
power. Bavaria, Wuertemberg and Baden may flirt with
liberalism, but no German would think on that account of
asking them to assume the r&ocirc;le of Prussia. Prussia must
brace herself, for the fitter moment. Prussia&#8217;s borders are
not favorable to the development of a healthy state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;What matter if they hang me, provided the rope binds
this new Germany more firmly to the throne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; A few days after this sensational defiance of Democratic
leaders, Bismarck announced his decision: &#8220;We shall carry
on the finances of the state without the conditions provided
for in the Constitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck was not surprised at the storms of protest.
&#8220;Some progressive journals hope to see me picking oakum
for the benefit of the state.&#8221; The comic newspapers pictured
Bismarck as a ballet dancer, pirouetting over eggs marked
Right, Law, Order, Reform, Constitution.</p>

<p>&para; The King became alarmed.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I see how this will end,&#8221; said the King. &#8220;Over there, near
the opera house, in front of my windows, they will cut off
your head, and mine a little afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;And after that, sire?&#8221; asked Bismarck spunkily.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;After that, why we shall be dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Oh, well, all must die,&#8221; cut in Bismarck indifferently, &#8220;and
the question is can a man die more honorably than for his
country? I am fighting for your cause, and you are sealing
with your own blood your rights as King, by the grace of
God.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Your Majesty is bound to fight! You cannot capitulate!
You must, even at the risk of bodily danger, go forth to meet
any attempt at coercion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; As Bismarck spoke, the King grew more and more animated.
&#8220;He began to assume the part of one fighting for
kingdom and fatherland,&#8221; wrote Bismarck, in explaining the
situation.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The giant&#8217;s very soul glowed with fiery indignation. It
was not in his nature to hesitate, as to means. He wanted
these 12,000,000 thalers for the army&mdash;and was not that
enough? True, he could not say in the open that he wished
to expel Austria&mdash;but must an elephant step on your foot?</p>

<p>&para; He had no scruples, moral or material; such are for lesser
men. Hamlet-questioning princes, if you please, may soliloquize
on life and its inner meaning; but not your Otto von<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Bismarck, with his clear view of the little lives of men and
with his correct conviction that if the intervening thirty-nine
German states are to be made a unit in a German Empire,
then under Heaven or under Hell, the thirty-nine states must
be seized, even in a hurricane of bullets if necessary. Could
anything be simpler? Had not the &#8220;German problem,&#8221; as
it was called, been talked to death generation after generation,
and had not lawyers, poets, preachers, philosophers and
petty princes unnumbered come and gone with their impossible
enterprises looking to National glory and political
legitimacy?</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck was, as usual, everlastingly correct in his political
instincts; and furthermore he had the iron will to power
to support him in this great Prussian conflict; yes, and the
wizardry in manipulating human nature that, in the end,
would cause even obstinate, opposed political leaders to do
our giant&#8217;s bidding.</p>

<p>&para; What he demanded was absolute, blind, unquestioning obedience
from this Assembly; then, the Prussian army must
fight like fiends; and lastly, he would take personal responsibility
for the issue. Mahommet himself never urged war on
Christian dogs with more zeal than did this fiery Bismarck,
battling with his own German kind. To shame them, to
beat them over their backs with hot irons if necessary&mdash;anything
would he do to force Prussia to fight Austria, and
arouse thus with a sense of blood-brotherhood the thirty-nine
states, for Germany&#8217;s great glory. This was his religion&mdash;and
do you now get the man behind it?</p>

<p>&para; Of course, it was all cleverly masked under the plea of
Prussian army reforms, pure and simple, and in general
the fight between Bismarck and the Chamber seemed to turn
on the right of a Minister to force appropriations for the
support of the government, regardless of parliamentary unwillingness.
Bismarck held to his general principle that
the Deputies had no authority to refuse the King funds to
enlarge the army. The deputies were pledged to support the
government, not to starve or ignore it, was Bismarck&#8217;s contention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; The Liberals raged and stormed, called him &#8220;demented
Bismarck,&#8221; &#8220;Napoleon worshiper,&#8221; &#8220;hollow braggart,&#8221; &#8220;a
country gentleman of moderate political training, inconsistent,
nonchalant, insolent to a degree;&mdash;pray when did Bismarck
ever express a political thought?&#8221;</p>

<p>King William&#8217;s choice was exceedingly unpopular, but between
Von Roon and Bismarck there was now to be set up the
most efficient military instrument known to history; that is
to say, an all-powerful Prussian army of gigantic proportions,
armed with the newly-invented needle-guns. Such was
to be Von Roon&#8217;s contribution. Bismarck&#8217;s was to arouse at
home the slumbering great &#8220;German National sentiment&#8221;
that made failure impossible, at the front. Under God, Bismarck
believed in the justness of his cause.</p>

<p>&para; In the interim, before the first cannon was to roar, Bismarck,
the political wizard, was to tie the hands of every
other European monarch&mdash;either by bribes, idle promises or
what you will&mdash;that the war might be fought to a finish
without hazard of Allies coming to the rescue of the Emperor
on the South.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The parliamentary debaters who thundered against Bismarck
came on with all manner of attacks. The learned v.
Sybel, the great authority on the French revolution, cried
out his many historical warnings; Dr. Virchow, known for
his work on skeletons of the mammoth, battled along other
historical lines; Dr. Gneist, the very learned member, exclaimed
in a burst of moral indignation, &#8220;This army reorganization
of yours has the marks of Cain on its brow!&#8221;
And to this insulting speech, von Roon immediately replied,
&#8220;That speech of yours bears the stamp of arrogance and
impudence!&#8221; Virchow challenged Bismarck to a duel, for
defamatory remarks on the doctor&#8217;s scientific attainments.
To this Bismarck replied:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I am past the time of life when one takes advice from
flesh and blood, in such things as now confront us. When
I stake my life for a matter, I do so in that faith which I
have strengthened by long and severe struggling&mdash;but also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in honest and humble prayer to God, a faith which no word
of man, even that of friend in Christ and servant of his
church, can overthrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Magnificent, magnificent you are, at this supreme moment,
you big bull-dog Bismarck, and you can whip them three to
one, when the great day comes.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck gained in power as he exercised his strength.
He kept Prussia steady during the perilous times of the
Crimean war; even urged an alliance with the French&mdash;think
of that!&mdash;to gain secret ends for Prussia; but the Prussian
king, who hated rulers of revolutionary origin, was opposed
to Bismarck&#8217;s master-scheme; that is to say, William held
in contempt Napoleon III, hero of the trick, known as the
coup d&#8217;etat, which won a crown. But Bismarck had no such
scruples.</p>

<p>At St. Petersburg, Bismarck won the Czar&mdash;for which the
liberals hated Otto the more. His arts of diplomacy were
expanding in all directions.</p>

<p>Foreshadowing the war with Austria, Bismarck planned to
keep Italy, France, Russia, England and Belgium quiet by
various intrigues of politics&mdash;and how well he succeeded we
shall learn later on.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The storm increases&mdash;Bismarck decides to defy the
Chamber and rule alone!</p></div>

<p>&para; In the general turmoil, along comes a fanatic named Cohen,
who attempts to kill Bismarck.</p>

<p>This was in May, 1866. The war broke within thirty days!
Cohen fired point-blank three shots, and there was a personal
struggle. The giant coolly handed the would-be murderer
over to the guards, then went home. His greeting to his
wife was characteristic. &#8220;They have tried even to kill me,
my dear, but do not mind, no harm has been done. Let us
go out to dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a time of assassins and their plots follow. Struck
down by the police, Ferd Cohen, step-son of Karl Blind,
meets in the eyes of the Democrats a martyr&#8217;s death; his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
body is crowned with flowers, as though the corpse were a
consecration of Prussian Liberalism on the altar of liberty.</p>

<p>The frenzy takes still other forms; suicide cults become notorious;
here and there, we read that some lunatic patriot
&#8220;seeks voluntary death, for the sacred cause of the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; And as for Cohen, ladies of high degree bring flowers,
soldiers of the common cause wear on their coats his picture
crowned with oak leaves. The cult of murder, with Bismarck
as the arch enemy in the centre of the picture, was indulged
to prevent what was termed the War of the Brothers.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I believe,&#8221; rumbled the granite rock Bismarck, with frowning
clouds around his brow, &#8220;I do solemnly believe in victory&mdash;whether
or not I shall live to see it!&#8221; This speech was
regarded as little short of blasphemy!</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck now spoke more than ever of God, and of high
German convictions. There was always grave danger of ingratitude,
of insufficiency of time and place, but he certainly
thought God on his side.</p>

<p>&para; What lashed Bismarck into fury was the contention that
the Crown and the two Chambers were equal, in political
legitimacy.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;All constitutional life,&#8221; roared Bismarck, &#8220;is based on
constitutional compromises.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Day after day, Bismarck, the Prussian bull-dog, and von
Roon, the terrifying drill-master, would appear at the Chamber,
on the oak bench in full view of the angry deputies.
Time and again, through political jugglery, angry members
attempted to oust the Minister, but Bismarck was equal to
every occasion. He actually ruled for four years without a
legal budget. He conceded that point, too. He set up that
it was his solemn sworn duty to support his King, and since
the Chamber refused to vote the 12,000,000 thalers, why, it
became the Minister&#8217;s duty to get the money, by fair means
or by foul.</p>

<p>&para; And get it, he did!</p>

<p>It was all wretchedly unconstitutional&mdash;of this there is no
doubt. Bismarck never made any pretenses on that score.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
After the Austrian war, an act of &#8220;immunity&#8221; was passed, in
his behalf.</p>

<p>&para; From quarreling about the secret war-chest, the disputants
next began a mighty wrangling about rules. Bismarck&#8217;s
points were always ingenious. He averred that, as King&#8217;s
Minister, he was &#8220;in&#8221; the parliament but not &#8220;of&#8221; it. &#8220;Ministers
must always be listened to with respect,&#8221; he contended.
Thus, he forced the unwilling Radicals to listen to his bellowing,
in behalf of the Brothers&#8217; War.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck construed in his own favor every blessed rule
brought up to oust him. The Minister was exempt from the
Chamber&#8217;s dominations, he insisted in a hundred ways.</p>

<p>Violent scenes followed. The King sent long messages endorsing
his fighting man; the Liberal press took up the cry,
in support of Parliament; and thereupon Bismarck promptly
muzzled the press.</p>

<p>&para; Our Otto is now becoming the best-hated man not only in
Prussia but in all Europe.</p>

<p>The deputies were brow-beaten, legislative officials intimidated
with threats.</p>

<p>&para; The climax came on that day of hubbub when angry members,
swarming around Bismarck and von Roon, were sent
back by von Roon&#8217;s thunderous defiance. Pointing to the
gangway before his bench, he hissed, &#8220;Thus far and no farther!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The real reason why Bismarck fought the Chamber for
four long years so desperately for the 12,000,000 thalers, to
be used against Austria, was this: On one hand he wished
to nullify the importance of the Prussian Parliament, and
especially in the matter of dictation to the King, either
under the Constitution or not; also, to thrust at the same
time, Austria out of the German body of the nation.</p>

<p>&para; He became a fanatic on the subject of expelling Austria
from Germany! He had no scruples, stopped at nothing,
paused at nothing; and at the right moment defied the Chamber,
smashed the Prussian Constitution that would restrain
the King&#8217;s action in peace or war&mdash;and ruled alone!</p>

<p>&para; There are few parallels in history of a stronger man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Looked at in a large way, we are forced to conclude that
the German masses were not ready to believe, at this moment,
in Bismarck&#8217;s Old Testament faith in a God of Battles.
To fulfil the Bismarckian political ideal, there was essential
an implied humility on part of the people; and this attitude
of submission and renunciation was a sin against the spirit
of &#8217;48. Bismarck&#8217;s idea of political efficiency was also by
no means worked out in detail; it had yet to find a place
for the tailor, the shoemaker and the barber, side by side
with the King of Prussia; even that miracle was ultimately
accomplished, but at the present hour the street-bred people
felt it their solemn duty to get up and howl, and to profess
to know nothing of political efficiency, wherever kings were
concerned.</p>

<p>&para; At all times, the speeches of the crowd in the market-place
were blatant enough, but there was also an unrecognized
undercurrent of courage and patriotism passing with the
flood that was to mean much to Germany, in days to come.
The cause of the crowd was really an early form of our vital
modernist democratic movement, not to be put down nor yet
shut out; all political life was to be revalued, also all new
ideas of political happiness were to be henceforth tested by
their virility and actuality, cutting away completely bookish
ideals.</p>

<p>&para; The part that lagged was this: leaders of the people were
soon over-engaged, so to say, with the many-sided aspects
and problems of the new political leadership; the German
compatriots failed at this time to realize their obligations to
a German Empire, to be; the people&#8217;s politicians were still
insular with little or no consciousness of the great German
National destiny just around the bend of the road. Thus,
Bismarck&#8217;s function was to force the people to join the National
movement&mdash;do so as it were in spite of themselves;
and when Bismarck fought back and called the people fools,
he did not pause there, but stopped at nothing to lead a
hitherto indifferent people to warlike patriotism over the
Austrian question&mdash;over which they had gabbled and slept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
for years. Bismarck&#8217;s unity of purpose for the Fatherland
deftly combined sordid as well as exalted motives.</p>

<p>&para; And the demands Bismarck finally made on German character
were not in vain. For years, however, he was looked
upon as an ogre in the eyes of the masses, who misread his
patriotism for jingoism in behalf of the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; Von Roon had the soldiers up at 4 o&#8217;clock in the morning,
incessantly drilling for the oncoming War of the Brothers.
The deadly needle-guns&mdash;von Roon&#8217;s secret&mdash;were relied on
to do superior work in the impending great crisis.</p>

<p>&para; Blood and iron&mdash;yes, that is the thing!</p>

<p>&para; About this time, Bismarck executes another master-stroke.
He decides to intervene in Poland, in favor of Russia; and
certainly he has now to face a &#8220;word of wrath.&#8221;</p>

<p>England sets up a cry, &#8220;Stop thief!&#8221; Exeter Hall statesmen,
&#8220;brotherhood of man&#8221; type, begin tearful whinings.</p>

<p>&para; Louis Napoleon tries to form an alliance between England
and Austria, and England offers gold for a copy of the Russo-Prussian
agreement, affecting Poland. Spies were everywhere.</p>

<p>&para; Well, 10,000 Poles perish in the sacred cause of liberty, but
mark: That in helping Russia Bismarck is laying the foundation
for Russia&#8217;s neutrality in the coming master-stroke
against Austria. What do the lives of 10,000 Poles weigh
in the balance beside the great strategic necessities to encompass
Bismarck&#8217;s idea of a United Germany? We do believe
that Bismarck has the only practical solution, let nominal
Christians say what they will.</p>

<p>&para; The next step, to bribe France, is brought about craftily,
through a customs&#8217; arrangement; and when some of the German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
states object, Bismarck replies: &#8220;You go my way or go
your own way, alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>Also, Italy has to be quieted by soothing promises!</p>

<p>&para; Austria now sets up more wind-baggery and gold lace, in
the form of a new parliament, but Bismarck counters with a
&#8220;proposed German parliament&#8221;&mdash;a spurious affair to be sure,
but the scare has its weight.</p>

<p>&para; Dark and intricate diplomacy here passes before the eyes.
Austria fails in her Congress of Sovereigns, and is anxious
likewise to retrieve her losses in the Italian war. Bismarck
at least knows that Austria henceforth is powerless to inflame
German states against Prussia, also that the growth
of Liberalism, within Austria&#8217;s own domains, is again keeping
her very busy.</p>

<p>&para; Cast your eyes toward Paris. Louis the Little is secretly
plotting with both sides&mdash;Bismarck&#8217;s spies tell all to the
old man up in Berlin! Secretly, Louis feels that Prussia
will be defeated; the French Emperor aims at what he calls
the balance of power&mdash;by which he means that while the
two big dogs are fighting, he will slip in and steal the bone?
Exactly that!</p>

<p>&para; Many years later, Bismarck writing of this period, makes
this confession:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Napoleon secretly thought that if Austria and Prussia
clashed, Austria would win and then France would step in
and &#8216;protect&#8217; Prussia; later on, in return for the price of her
French favor, Napoleon III believed he could make such
terms as he wished with our Prussia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Thus, up to the decisive battle of Sadowa, or Koeniggraetz,
France remains politely bowing and scraping to both sides&mdash;while
having her understanding with each side.</p>

<p>Napoleon feels that he will in time be asked to intervene, and
for his help he will take a slice of the Rhineland.</p>

<p>Bismarck did not undeceive France&mdash;mark that well! Later
in life, the Man of Blood and Iron, taunted with the charge
of attempting to give away German territory, made a strong
&#8220;diplomatic&#8221; defense. He fearlessly produced the draft of a
proposed treaty showing that France was conniving to acquire
Belgium, through the under-play of politics, aided by
Bismarck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>The amusing part was Bismarck&#8217;s solemn reply, &#8220;The treaty
was drawn up by Napoleon himself, and was offered to me
for signature!&#8221;</p>

<p>Also, to show that he is disinterested, Napoleon now proposes
that the &#8220;differences&#8221; between Prussia and Austria be
settled by a European congress. Austria hangs back, although
England and Russia join to ask for the Congress of
Settlement.</p>



<h5><a name="s46" id="s46"></a>46</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1864-1866&mdash;Prussian domination essential in all Bismarck&#8217;s
plans&mdash;Consistent in his inconsistencies.</p></div>

<p>&para; The difficulties of Bismarck&#8217;s position are not to be ascribed
to the fact that, first and foremost, he desired to re-establish
confidence in the Feudal theory of Divine-right of kings.
His life-long plans had to do with increasing the power of
Prussia and he preached the legitimacy of his loyal master&#8217;s
house as an American politician is wont to eulogize the services
of the &#8220;grand old Republican party,&#8221; or &#8220;the great principles
of Jefferson,&#8221; or boasts that he is &#8220;progressive and
independent,&#8221; whatever that may mean.</p>

<p>In each case, the appeal is to a given audience, with the hope
of adding to the following.</p>

<p>&para; The logic of hereditary influences placed Bismarck squarely
in line as King&#8217;s Man; and to his credit be it said that he
consistently preached one gospel throughout his long political
life.</p>

<p>But his alignment with kings was more than mere opportunism,
as too often is the case in America, among the &#8220;people&#8217;s&#8221;
leaders.</p>

<p>Bismarck honestly believed that the logic of events precluded
any change in rulership over the Prussian people; and in his
larger view Prussian domination must eventually spread over
the German states, uniting them in one country&mdash;as they were
already united by blood and by languages.</p>

<p>&para; That he battled with Austria, the rival for the good will
of the German states, is easily explained. It is not human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
nature for any man to yield what to him promises to turn
out an advantage.</p>

<p>That the sovereigns of Prussia held their crown upon the
principle of Divine-right, was construed also to impose obligations;
and it was part of the theory that the King and his
advisers must see to it that the land is used for the common
good. The King of Prussia swore to &#8220;Divine-right to the
soil; swore to defend it; swore to improve it, for the benefit
of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Furthermore, the old-time German political idealism in
which brother was supposed to shake hands with brother,
sung by the poet Arndt, in his romantic semi-religious lyrics
of liberty, was through the recent German revolution (1848)
replaced by a new type of positivist German, intent on money-success,
business affairs, economic achievements.</p>

<p>The century-long dreams of National unity based on idealistic
speeches, poetry, romantic phrase-mongering, was now
slowly to yield to a new spirit; and believers in German
Unity came to see that Prussian supremacy held all there
was, in a practical way, of possible German centralization.
Bismarck certainly saw it very clearly and acted accordingly
in his future political appeals and alignments.</p>

<p>&para; Prussia had early led in the practical business of clearing
the Chinese-walls that had bound many of the petty states;
the Zollverein or customs&#8217; union, begun in 1818, as heretofore
explained, grew in power with the extension of Prussian
railroads and telegraphs; the Prussian capitalistic middle-classes,
intent on building up the family fortunes, had prospered
in proportion as the customs&#8217; union had been extended,
under Prussian domination; and accordingly in 1849 Bismarck,
as soon as Prussia had been placed herself at the
head of this Business Union, began scheming as never before
to win German Unity through economic as well as patriotic
arguments.</p>

<p>For one thing, Bismarck henceforth studied to put himself
on even terms with the commercial interests in the 39 jealous
states. The leaders of Liberalism were, as a rule, men of
theoretical rather than practical ideas; essentially a cultured
&eacute;lite, as it were, engaged in babbling about German Constitutions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
German fraternal alignments and impossible German
peace-parliaments.</p>

<p>&para; True, the good faith of patriots opposed to Bismarck
is undisputed; but the King&#8217;s Man was a man with an exceedingly
strong will and with immense practical common
sense to support his own ideas; a man who to bring about
his beneficent plan of German Unity followed his flag even
through three great wars.</p>

<p>This will of iron was exercised for the National good; and
on the whole exercised wisely. He went on with his schemings
for many years, from day to day making the best use
of the material at hand; with well-nigh infallible instinct
seizing on the very forces that were essential in years to
come to the realization of his ultimate dream.</p>

<p>&para; Little by little he set aside the professorial class, and the
cultured &eacute;lite politicians, and the theoretical constitution-makers;
in their places he brought forward hard-headed
middle-class capitalists, on one side, and the supreme military
and landed Prussian aristocracy, on the other side; and
after overcoming gigantic obstacles made clear to the average
German peasant that both wealth and authority were to
be properly sustained in the old thorough-going German
fashion only by having no more to do with semi-spiritual,
politico-idealistic aims and purposes; also, that through Bismarck&#8217;s
proposed new type of Unity the peasant on one
side and the King on the other could rise to even higher
worldly positions without setting aside safe old lines of respect
for authority through a Divine-right king, at the same
time sharing the royal power with a great and essentially
democratic public opinion. Thus, Bismarck&#8217;s German National
enterprise, although not thoroughly understood for
many years, was found at last to support in every particular
the ancient German tradition of a strong fighting man, as
leader of a free people.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; That Bismarck was proud and old-fashioned he made his
boast, his joy, his strength.</p>

<p>Opponents held him up to obloquy, picturing his ideas as prehistoric,
even antediluvian; but Bismarck stood the prick of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
honor; as King&#8217;s Man he insisted in numberless arguments,
far and wide, that behind the Divine-right idea was not only
a sentimental but a practical side. At any rate, the King&#8217;s
Man was everlastingly against any movement that looked
like French mob-rule.</p>

<p>&para; As time passed, Bismarck learned gradually that he need
not hesitate to throw himself fearlessly forward, with this
Divine-right as a leverage, to express the legitimacy of the
royal house for which he battled.</p>

<p>In the final analysis he was secretly fortified by his instinctive
knowledge of the peculiar political idiosyncrasies of Prussians;
how dog-like in the final analysis is their submission
to the political conception of the Over-man who rules by
Divine-right.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It was to this National faith that Bismarck was constantly
addressing himself&mdash;this loyalty to a paternalistic idea&mdash;and
his attitude was much the same as that of the Chinese in
their worship of ancestors, or of an American who preserves
his family record.</p>

<p>Bismarck was urging family unity among quarreling German
sons and daughters; and as is the case in all family
feuds, the intrinsic merits of the controversy were often overlooked
and the time taken in an endeavor to inflict personal
humiliations.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck was essentially appealing to National honor,
which he placed higher than absolutism or republicanism, tyranny
or democracy. By National honor, he meant the German
conception of an over-lord for a ruler, preferably one
with a strong military record.</p>

<p>Herein, we touch the core of Bismarck&#8217;s strength, the measure
of his greatness.</p>

<p>When a man fights, on honor, for institutions which his forefathers
slowly fostered and sustained through six hundred
years of strife, the question of his rights or his wrongs is
merged into the larger question of chivalry.</p>

<p>&para; If there were no other gift which might be set up to justify
for Bismarck a commanding position among the world&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
great figures, his conception of National honor, based on
powerful personal convictions, his inheritance, bone of his
bone, flesh of his flesh&mdash;utterly apart from the French mob-rule
idea of liberty expressed in license&mdash;Bismarck&#8217;s plea for
the National honor of Prussia, as the custodian of ancient
German traditions, suffices to stamp Bismarck as the true
custodian of German political tradition of his age.</p>

<p>&para; To this might reasonably be added another claim which in
our broad view of Bismarck&#8217;s character we here demand for
him as one of the world&#8217;s great men&mdash;courage of the bull-dog
type, not altogether unselfish, but courage and remarkable
consistency; standing the acid test of self-sacrifice during
thirty-odd years&#8217; vexatious delays in attaining his goal; a
period of probation certainly long enough to try the stoutest
heart.</p>

<p>&para; With qualities of this supreme order, far outside average
human nature, Bismarck at last prepared himself to win his
surprising fight for a United Germany; incidentally stamping
himself, his power and his purpose high among the great
Germans of all time, from Charlemagne down.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; To understand these ideas, let us for the moment look forward
as well as backward. Let us speak in general terms,
along the lines of the realistic politics, that Bismarck was
maturing, as against the old-time German sentimental idealism,
once the political hope of Unity.</p>



<h5><a name="s47" id="s47"></a>47</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bismarck&#8217;s whole message turns on the urgency of
faith among the German people; his idea, that
United Germany must be achieved by faith, alone!</p></div>

<p>&para; Bismarck had the well-nigh impossible task of organizing
and inspiring a common political faith in 25,000,000 people,
divided by religious, climatic and personal differences. That
at times he utterly failed to meet the situation except by
political hypocrisy, is merely to say that in addition to being
a warrior and ultimately the conqueror of a continent, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
always kept within hailing distance of human nature; for
when he could not win his way with a kiss, he gained it with
a curse.</p>

<p>&para; In the final analysis he won, largely because of stirring
faith in the German states.</p>

<p>With faith, what can a nation not do: If the United States,
today, had deathless belief in the destiny of the Republic
that Americans emphasize in their worship of the Golden
Calf, a bloodless revolution for a higher standard of political
thought would take place over night.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that with the average American National
faith is dead.</p>

<p>He has come to the conclusion that he has no stake in the
Government, that in short he is a victim to the machinations
of plutocrats.</p>

<p>To read the American point of view, (1915) we, today, no
less than the Prussians and the Austrians, in Bismarck&#8217;s
time, are also about to spring at each other&#8217;s throats! There
is little sentiment for National unity; it is the East against
the West, in Congress, and in the newspapers it is the people
against the plutocrats.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s career affords a classical instance, in these poor
times, of what a strong man, with faith in himself and his
cause, can do against all manner of obstacles.</p>

<p>Faith in himself was the essence of his power. Over and
over, he made clear that he regarded himself in God&#8217;s hands,
doing God&#8217;s work, but on what specific evidence he based this
profound conclusion no human being knows beyond Bismarck&#8217;s
own assertion. However, that power urged him on.
Naturally, in turn, the fire kindled by faith in himself at last
stimulated faith in a people, numbering some twenty-five
millions; a people who in the main had up to this time been
political atheists to Bismarck&#8217;s dogma of a United Germany.
This idea of faith is a fact of such vast import that we dare
not pass it lightly by.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; By an almighty wave of faith in themselves the German
people ceased playing the political craven; came out boldly
for what they hold to be their too long deferred birthright!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, the mental attitude of the German people passes beyond
the dogmas of politics or social intercourse whatsoever;
it merges into a mysterious world of reality, close and
near yet baffling to describe; expressing itself in an invincible
National faith, now about to burst forth, at last, and
sweep all before it!</p>

<p>&para; This mental phenomenon exists in various forms, but the
animating impulse is ever the same.</p>

<p>The hymn-singing of Charles and John Wesley, whose appeals
to religious emotionalism filled the fields of England
with tens of thousands of weeping, shouting men and women,
vastly excited as to the state of their souls, is a type of faith
beginning in a small way and attaining National proportions.
No historian could write adequately the history of England
without crediting great changes to the work of the Wesley
psalm-singers; women tearing off their jewels; men rising in
the multitude and calling on God to witness that henceforth
their lives would be pure and unsullied by sin; while under
the excitement murderers came forward and confessed crimes
known only to themselves.</p>

<p>&para; Oh, this German National faith that Frederick the Great
so gloriously began; that Louise fostered and sustained; that
the poet Arndt set to hymns; that the great von Humboldt
in his own peculiar way saw from afar; that the German
students apostrophied; that William III figured to himself
in his church-building; that von Stein discerned vaguely;
that William I emphasized in his cold-blooded, clear-eyed
manner of the soldier; that von Sybel fought for; that
scores, nay, hundreds and thousands of noble men and
women, utterly apart from political chicanery, did indeed
long for with all the fervor of their earnest God-fearing German
nature; Bismarck stands in the centre, here and now!</p>

<p>&para; It is true that he is not as yet accepted, but he is biding
his time; he is looked on with suspicion, but he fronts the
scorn of the rabble, in the end to beat the doubters into submission,
against their own will.</p>

<p>&para; This newly awakened German National faith was really a
very old German faith that had never died, although for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
years forgotten; the longing for the Fatherland was always
there.</p>

<p>&para; Through love of home, through worship of ancestry and
through respect for constituted authority in church and
state, that is by &#8220;German national faith,&#8221; Bismarck touched
the chord that made his life-work possible. The stimulus of
three great wars, presented by Bismarck as sanctified by
God, finally did the business.</p>

<p>&para; He knew that in all Germans is a certain generosity of
character which when appealed to in the right way made
them eager to take the chance of death on the battlefield.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck played the positive as well as the negative side
of this psychological fact. On the negative side, he stirred
men with the idea that social ostracism rests on the man who
in times of National danger tries to avoid the draft.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s work thus shows him to be the great constructive
poet of his time. He placed war before his fellow man
in such a way that it was held a sweet privilege to die for
one&#8217;s land, which interpreted means Bismarck&#8217;s idea of a new
territorial arrangement of the map of Europe.</p>

<p>&para; There was race prejudice behind his deeper plans. He
made much of the fact that within a given area the German
language was spoken, whereas while there were millions of
German-speaking people in Austria there were also Slavs,
Czechs, Bohemians and mongrel races.</p>

<p>&para; The idea of brotherhood based on blood and language
finally prevailed over the idea of the confraternity of races.
Make as much out of this as you will, but the basic fact is
incontestible.</p>

<p>&para; Some 80,000 men perished to sustain Bismarck&#8217;s peculiar
conception of United Germany. Through the turmoil and
misery of these three wars he had his way, and being at last
successful, he suddenly became the most popular man in
Europe, idolized by the millions who a little while before had
reviled his name as the enemy of the Democrats.</p>

<p>&para; Such is human nature.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Perhaps, after all, German National faith is only another
name for the tremendous earnestness that set the whole land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
ablaze with singleness of purpose, consecrated to a high
cause.</p>

<p>Bismarck in a very real sense because of faith in himself and
in his ultimate cause, directed this National faith in the
Fatherland and won thereby a magnificent United Germany.
If we do not grasp the significance of this unseen but gigantic
National German faith, as expressed in the increasing
unity of will of the whole people, harked on by Prussia, we
might as well close the book on Bismarck&mdash;and know him
not.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; To comprehend, somewhat, the firm roots of racial strength,
as expressed by German National faith, let us for the moment
pass from the 1840&#8217;s, &#8217;50&#8217;s and &#8217;60&#8217;s, which we are now
endeavoring to present with their psychological message of
faith, and turn our eyes to the year 1914, when Germany
and Austria, no longer enemies, now battle side by side,
against armed forces of the world&mdash;British, Russian, Italian,
Servian, French, Australian, East Indian, African,
Belgian, Canadian, and Japanese!</p>

<p>The sustaining spirit in this life-and-death struggle, as in
the wars that made Germany an empire, is bulwarked on
German National faith.</p>

<p>&para; For Germans are no longer soft-hearted heroes of lyrical
poetry, as depicted by Arndt! They are men of blood and
iron.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s mother threw her wedding ring into the public
melting pot for the benefit of the War Fund of 1813 and received
in exchange a ring of iron; and thousands of German
women did the same; and Bismarck&#8217;s wife exchanged her
gold ring for one of iron, for the War Fund of &#8217;66. Tens of
thousands of German women did likewise, not only in Germany,
but in foreign lands, wherever hearts beat for the
Fatherland.</p>

<p>They did it in 1813, and in 1864, and in 1866, and in 1870;&mdash;and
again in 1914!</p>

<p>&para; For example, in the great war of 1914, Baroness von Ropp,
granddaughter of Geo. Ebers, Germany&#8217;s most foremost
woman novelist, cries out for her country in the accents of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
true German nationality, the self-same spirit which Arndt
stimulated in days of French and Austrian domination. And
since it is this elusive spirit that we are endeavoring to
bring home to you, in grasping the higher significance of Bismarck&#8217;s
work, and its true inner meaning, we quote freely
from a private letter penned by the Baroness, from Magdeburg,
August, 1914.</p>

<p>Ilse Hahn-Ropp did not write for publication, and therefore
her words have the more weight.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;On the first day of mobilization I traveled to Magdeburg
to say farewell to my husband, who was leaving for France.
I had three hours; then I had to take the last train out of
town. From that time only military trains were running.
Shall I ever forget that ride? It was as though we were
living in another world. People were standing in the cars
closely packed together; but not a word of complaint. Each
one felt he was no longer an individual&mdash;but a German!
Rich and poor, nobles and peasants, talked together as
brothers. Each had the deep conviction that this war had
been forced upon us, and that every one must throw his
whole strength into the scales, for victory.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Ceaselessly, military trains roll by, crowded with soldiers
in gala uniforms, burning to reach the enemy. I hear
them all night long from my parents&#8217; home&mdash;those wheels
rolling, rolling westward; no hurry, no confusion; the mighty
machine moves majestically on its way. Show us another
nation which could duplicate that spectacle!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;And then, from a thousand throats, rose &#8216;Die Wacht am
Rhein.&#8217; It was overpowering&mdash;irresistible. This mighty anthem,
from the lips of soldiers going out to battle!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;It was thus that both my brothers left us. I shall never,
never forget. Every one gives his all gladly. I could not
keep my husband with me, although exempt through his profession
from military duty. He went as a volunteer, and I
would not have held him if I could, though you can guess the
cost of that parting!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;One hears not a single complaint from the women of the
Fatherland. We are all too thoroughly roused over the insults
offered our loved country. Working each waiting moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
for our wounded&mdash;for our soldiers&mdash;we have no time
for tears.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;We will not give in until all are defeated, even though we
women should have to take up the sword to defend the
Fatherland. Were it not for my baby daughter I should be
with my husband, as a nurse.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;You cannot picture how great, how noble, how grave this
time is. Human nature is transfigured. Individual fate is
lost, in the fate of the Nation.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I am at home with my parents. Scarcely a year has passed
since my happy, peaceful wedding day. And now my home
is bare and desolate, and I am again the daughter of my
father&mdash;I can write no more. My feelings are stifling me.
The bells are ringing a new victory. Unfurl the black-white-red
banner. Always lovingly yours,</p>

<p class="right">
ILSE.&#8221;
</p>

<p>A postscript reads:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oct. 6.&mdash;For six weeks I have been trying to send this letter&mdash;in
vain. In the meantime both my brothers have died
fighting for the Fatherland. My husband still lives, but&mdash;we
must, we shall and must win!&#8221;</p>



<h5><a name="s48" id="s48"></a>48</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bismarck balances between tempestuous outbursts
and inscrutable silence; biding his time in the great
game of German Unity.</p></div>

<p>&para; In the gigantic project of creating an Empire for a king
who solemnly protested that he was directly accountable to
God for the throne, &#8220;and would never consent to have so
much as a sheet of paper (constitution) between my people
and my Maker.&#8221; Bismarck was under tremendous nervous
pressure for years; and he meant that his political secrets
for United Germany should not become too early known.
Not only were the people as yet unwilling to help, but Austria
was watching with jealous eyes the possibility of plunder
for herself;&mdash;for where the carrion is there will the vultures
wheel.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s ambition bit him by day and by night, and there
was for him no rest; he required a continent to turn &#8217;round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in, and nothing less would suffice. It was now only a question
of waiting for the psychological moment to electrify the
inert mass of the people to rally to his cause.</p>

<p>&para; Naturally you ask, &#8220;Was this Bismarck then a beast?&#8221;
Not at all. He was merely a human being who wanted a
continent to turn around in.</p>

<p>In the gigantic project, Bismarck was exercising his own
peculiar gifts in his own way&mdash;for none stood ready to give
him what he wanted, without fighting for it&mdash;even as you
or I lay out lesser plans to beg, or coax, or force the world
to give us not what we think we need but what we are
strong enough to obtain.</p>

<p>&para; In this attitude, Bismarck needs neither apology nor defense&mdash;for,
after all, he is Bismarck.</p>

<p>Through thirty-odd years of din and roar and battle largely
of his own making Bismarck knew neither rest nor peace;
returning again and again to the attack and wearing down
his enemies by the sheer brute force of courage. His idea
was United Germany, through Prussian military power; at
the same time, Prussia must hold her dynastic over-lordship,
and must yield it finally only in a territorial German Empire.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Unquestionably there was, incidentally, a large element of
injustice in his plans and purposes, but what of it? Is there
not such in your own life, and do you know any man whose
career is not based on injustice either in some coarse, obvious
or in some subtle way?</p>

<p>The world belongs only to those who do battle, and there
is absolutely no chance for the man who will not fight!</p>

<p>All government is based on some form of injustice, all land
tenure is stained with the sword, all &#8220;putting up&#8221; of one
family, or individual, is based on &#8220;taking&#8221; something from
some other family or individual.</p>

<p>Nor am I excepting the conquests of love itself, from time
immemorial presented as a token of man&#8217;s romantic, softer
side. For, if the hero does not &#8220;save&#8221; the heroine from the
villain, to take her for himself, then for whom does he save
her?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; The Bismarck struggle and the Bismarck triumph are as
old as history&mdash;and as new as the career of the man of today
who has achieved his heart&#8217;s desire.</p>

<p>The empire-maker Bismarck had his way because he was
strong enough to have his way, and while cruelties in various
forms, for the ends of statecraft, coexisted in him with many
fine qualities, after all that simply means that he was a
human being with impulses of various kinds&mdash;good and less
good&mdash;in one heart. It is also an undeniable fact that as
late as 1862 Bismarck was by the common crowd in Prussia
hated and feared, regarded as Germany&#8217;s ogre of disaster.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Here then is the whole thing in a nutshell: His strong conservative,
not to say reactionary, sentiments did not blind
him to the fact that he could do nothing without the &#8220;people,&#8221;
whom politically he ignored in so far as their fitness
for constructive government was concerned; but it was the
&#8220;people,&#8221; and the &#8220;people&#8221; only, who could bring United
Germany.</p>

<p>He realized the present impracticability of such a Union as
he had in mind for his master, the King of Prussia; that
to urge it too soon would simply bring a new revolution, and
God knows there had been enough blood-letting for the sake
of power in and around Prussia for lo! these one hundred
years gone by.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The only thing for him to do, then, was to keep his ambition
to himself and his own crowd, and to bide his time to
strike&mdash;for time makes all things right for him who can
wait.</p>

<p>And at waiting and at concealing Bismarck was past master.
While usually figured as a blunt, bold, tyrannical man, there
was also a side of inscrutable reticence.</p>

<p>&para; Thus finally between outbursts of temper in which he attacked
his enemies with the power of a battleship in action,
followed by periods of silence after the storm, Bismarck remained
master of the diplomatic situation, playing his waiting
game.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; And did his stern face never break into an ironical smile?
Did he never betray himself?</p>

<p>It was impossible to preserve his great political secret from
the intuitions of other and lesser minds.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; You see, men have various ways of getting their will.
Some fight, others play, still others threaten suicide if the
money is not forthcoming. It is all a matter of temperament
and peculiar style of doing battle.</p>

<p>With some, a curse will bring what a kiss will not; with
others a club is more useful than a loving word. With Bismarck,
the first instinct was to do battle by fire and sword,
and this explains why his career is filled with broken wine
bottles, fist cuffs, sword thrusts, and his &#8220;sic &#8217;em!&#8221; to the big
dogs that trailed around with him.</p>

<p>&para; Once, during the crisis of which we now write, on going into
a saloon for a glass of beer, some table talk on politics
offended him. He ordered the man to stop, then and there,
&#8220;or I will smash a beer glass over your head!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man went on talking; Bismarck drank, turned around
and said, &#8220;That for you!&#8221; smashed the tankard on the offending
head, and coolly walked out!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He is no longer the roaring delegate of the &#8220;White
Saloon,&#8221; but has developed the astuteness of the
devil, the open sincerity of a saint.</p></div>

<p>&para; Fight, fight, fight! Nothing but fight! And all this trying
time, Bismarck suffered excruciating pains from his old
rheumatic complaint.</p>

<p>He was irritable, melancholy and jaundiced; sat up all night
half-buried in his mounds of state papers; dictating telegrams,
quarreling with callers, denouncing, adjusting, scheming;
four o&#8217;clock found him in bed; he tossed about till seven,
when he managed to get to sleep; and was not seen again
till late in the afternoon. The situation was getting on the
master&#8217;s nerves.</p>

<p>&para; Enemies in the house of his friends spied on Bismarck,
endeavored to poison the King against the doughty Minister.
The Crown Prince, especially, who always had an aversion
to Bismarck, despite the war-dog&#8217;s inestimable services
to the House of Hohenzollern, now tried to pull the
Pomeranian giant down.</p>

<p>To this end, the Prince dissassociated himself from Bismarck&#8217;s
policy, avoided the great man at court. The situation
passed rapidly from political to social objections on
part of the Prince, who spread before the King the ruin of
Hohenzollern if Bismarckian policies were longer pursued.</p>

<p>&para; But the King would not give Bismarck up. In this regard,
William was as cold as ice. He saw that should Bismarck
be asked to go, at that time, the Liberals would be irresistibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
strengthened. The recoil of the mighty wave against
kingcraft might even end by forcing abdication for the Prussian
monarch.</p>

<p>&para; Instead of fearing the Liberal leaders, Bismarck despised
their plots. The master knew enough of human nature to
see clearly one great central fact. The fire-breathing Democrats
would, at the hour of Prussia&#8217;s peril, join with the
hated system of Bismarck and march to glory. In defense
of Prussia, Liberals, Socialists and political nonconformists
of every description, would be carried off their feet. Then,
Bismarck would be able to call on his very enemies to come
forward and help him win the day.</p>

<p>&para; And the old man, as usual, was absolutely correct. In the
hour of danger how the Prussian Liberals fought! Like
fiends they stood, took the murderous fire and went to their
death singing, &#8220;I am a Prussian, will a Prussian be!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The opportunity to test German National faith first came
through the Holstein war, precipitated by Bismarck&#8217;s clever
manipulation of events.</p>

<p>&para; As well ask from what quarters of the globe the hurricane
came which last night tore up the old oak tree. You can
read a dozen fat volumes on the Holstein problem, and still
you will not be convinced. Schleswig-Holsteiners in their
rock-grit lands on the North Sea had their political troubles
about the right of succession, and that sort of thing; the
spit of land up there was aflame with war talk.</p>

<p>&para; The Germans, as a people, wished Schleswig attached as a
principality of the German Confederation, but Bismarck&#8217;s
secret plan was to seize the territory for the gain of Prussia,
a clean political theft of a huge estate. By pushing the
Danes out of the Frankfort Diet&mdash;that antiquated political
stuffed-club of Austria&mdash;the Emperor of the South would
also be forced out of German affairs. In a few words, that
was the play.</p>

<p>&para; Opposition? Why, Bismarck lived by opposition, grew fat
on opposition. He is no longer the old roaring delegate of
the &#8220;White Saloon,&#8221; in his blossom time. He has developed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the astuteness of the devil, the open sincerity of a saint. As
a matter of fact, he now invited Austria &#8220;to co-operate,&#8221; in
settling the complex Danish question; and the unsuspecting
Emperor of the South, who was also playing a deep game of
his own, decided to take a hand.</p>

<p>&para; Throughout his long career, Bismarck was everlastingly
trading in political advantages. Often there was a large
element of imagination in his promises to pay, but he gained
his point in the Holstein problem. He had to face: Dissension
between the Prussian Chamber and the Government; the
feeling in rival German states; the general distrust of Prussia
and the hostility of Austria; finally, the jealousy of other
powers.</p>

<p>&para; Volumes have been written, learned decisions handed down
on the complex rights of the warring houses of Schleswig-Holstein.
There were mountains of precedents on this side
or that, as you pleased. Bismarck&#8217;s plan was to annex the
domain to Prussia and seize the harbor of Kiel, with all the
accrued advantages to the Prussian monarch; and while the
talk went on Bismarck man&#339;uvered to enlist his old enemy,
Austria, to make common cause in a clear way of plunder,
if ever there was one. Then, they swept the country with
fire and sword, took it by the &#8220;divine right&#8221; of the strongest;
and it fell out that Bismarck stacked the cards against
Austria, as a gambler stacks them against the man on the
other side of the table who is supposed to be his friend, in
a gentleman&#8217;s game. Bismarck at a stroke thus won away
Austria&#8217;s share.</p>

<p>&para; After the conquest of the Holstein duchies, King William
became more ambitious; henceforth the object of his life
was the aggrandizement of Prussia, in Germany. Bismarck
had given the King the taste of blood. The Iron Chancellor
admits the fact. Here are Bismarck&#8217;s exact words, from his
interviews with Dr. Busch: &#8220;The King&#8217;s frame of mind underwent
a psychological change; he developed a taste for
conquest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck laid the foundation in this way: He reminded
the reluctant William of the glories of Hohenzollern; how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
each Hohenzollern had added to the common family fortunes,
ever-widening estates and power. He told William how King
Fr: Wm. IV had acquired Hohenzollern and the Jande District;
Fr: Wm. III, the Rhine Province; Fr: Wm. II, Poland;
Fr: II, Silesia; Fr: Wm. I, Old Hinter Pomerania; the Great
Elector, Further Pomerania, etc.; &#8220;and I encouraged the King
to do likewise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Is it too much to say that in this great National crisis,
Bismarck was more than servant of the King? In many
respects Bismarck was the King&#8217;s master. &#8220;If you only
knew how I had to struggle to make the King go to war
with Austria!&#8221; is a significant comment Bismarck once made
in a moment of confidence.</p>

<p>It is a question whether he loved the King more, or himself
less.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; &#8220;My party consisted solely of the King and myself,&#8221; wrote
Bismarck many years later, &#8220;and my only aim was the restoration
and aggrandizement of the German Empire and
the defense of monarchial authority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; He always had a contempt for parliaments and for parties.
This fact is so clear that we pass it without further comment.
In short, Bismarck measures up to these lines in
Tennyson:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Ah, God! for a man with heart, head, hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some of the simple great ones gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever and ever by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One still strong man in a blatant land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever they call him, what care I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aristocrat, democrat, autocrat&mdash;&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&para; However, in this world all things are relative; the finest
coat has its reverse side, where the ugly seams show; and
Bismarck is no exception. He has all the strong man&#8217;s
virtues, and vices. Make the most of it.</p>

<p>It is a solemn fact that, in his unfailing loyalty to his
country, Bismarck showed little consideration for men who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
chanced to oppose his own principles&mdash;but what would you,
pray?</p>

<p>Man at best is a curious animal; he indulges in great wars
and he is capable of great mercies; he is all things by turn
and nothing long; on the same day he loves and he hates,
he commits crimes and he goes to church; he has his way
and having it, is still dissatisfied.</p>

<p>&para; And Bismarck was no exception.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; He always expected absolute obedience. &#8220;My ambassadors,&#8221;
he once said to one of them, &#8220;must wheel round like
non-commissioned officers, at a word of command, without
knowing why.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; &#8220;There are indeed,&#8221; says Sir Spencer Walpole, &#8220;few things
more remarkable in modern history than Bismarck&#8217;s determined
disregard, from 1863 to 1866 of the decisions of Parliament
and his readiness to stake his own life and that of
his sovereign on the issue of the contest.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; This Holstein raid was justified as &#8220;statecraft,&#8221; but the
gambler&#8217;s nerve and the gambler&#8217;s methods were behind it,
from end to end; and Bismarck shuffled and cut and stacked,
and if now and then some shrewd player caught the sleight
of hand and protested, Bismarck coolly banged him over the
head with a chair or flung a wine bottle at his head and
threw him into the street to make off as best he might,
smarting for revenge but not daring to raise a hand; for in
his heart the defeated player realized that in a game of this
kind the only thing to do is to take one&#8217;s medicine, &#8220;put up,
pay up and shut up&#8221;&mdash;like the lesser known but equally discerning
gamblers of old Mississippi steamboat days.</p>

<p>&para; What were they fighting about in Holstein? Alas, who
knows, except that Bismarck had his great German enterprise
well under way. It was said, at the time, that Disraeli
was &#8220;the only man in Europe who really understood the
Holstein question,&#8221; but Disraeli was a British cynic on all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
things German, and his explanations must be taken with a
grain of salt. However, Disraeli used Bismarck as &#8220;Count
Ferroll&#8221; in &#8220;Endymion.&#8221;</p>



<h5><a name="s50" id="s50"></a>50</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bismarck sleeps surrounded by windrows of the
dead; it was the moment he had awaited, all these
years.</p></div>

<p>&para; One fact should never be overlooked. Whether Bismarck
talks to his countrymen of patriotism or of religious duties,
through it all and behind it all, while framing constitutions
and putting the ballot in every man&#8217;s hand, Bismarck always
had something to draw to&mdash;and this something was the invincible
Prussian army.</p>

<p>This Prussian army, together with Prussian dog-like discipline,
made Bismarck&#8217;s plans possible.</p>

<p>&para; Also, he everlastingly kept the substance of power for
himself and his King; for, however much Bismarck from
time to time made concessions to the Liberal side, Bismarck
always nourished sentiments of royalty, in the end deftly
substituted the mailed fist for his talks on religious faith.</p>

<p>&para; His war-dramas are always rich in strife; but somehow,
he makes them conclude in joy.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Realizing that the Austrian war could not much longer be
put off, Bismarck&#8217;s great care was that there should be no
powerful coalitions against Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; We have spoken before of his closeness to Russia, and the
means whereby Bismarck secured the Czar&#8217;s neutrality in
the oncoming Austrian war. The King&#8217;s man next settled
with Italy, behind the screen. He knew that she longed to
come into possession of Venetian powers, held by Austria;
Bismarck got after the Italian minister, Lamarmora; the
bargain was this: A secret treaty promising Venetia to Italy;
no separate peace to be made with Austria; the treaty not
to be binding unless Prussia declared war within three
months.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Then Bismarck crossed over and proposed to Austria that
Frankfort &#8220;reform&#8221; the Confederation. The lure to the
Liberals was the promise of a National Convention elected
by the people, to decide on a new Constitution; the solution
carried the Holstein question, Bismarck averred, &#8220;not as a
piece of monarchial greed but as a National affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Bavaria agreed provided Austria and Prussia would not
attack each other.</p>

<p>&para; At this, Bismarck promised to give to Italy the Venetian
provinces, by peaceful arrangement&mdash;war or no war. But
Italy wavered; she was afraid of Bismarck&#8217;s behind-the-screen
policies.</p>

<p>Austria decided to increase her Venetian armaments, and
Bismarck, quick as a cat, seized on this move of his old
enemy as an act of &#8220;insincerity&#8221; in regard to peace.</p>

<p>&para; Austria now replied by urging that the Holstein question
be left to the Diet, despite the fact that Prussia had expressly
denied the competency of Frankfort to settle questions
affecting Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; From this point events moved with rapidity toward war.
Troops under Manteuffel marched into Holstein, alleging the
Gastein treaty broken; Austrians retired, but under protest,
alleging that Prussia had violated Section 11 of the Acts
of Confederation, which provided that members could not
make war against each other; and Austria moved that the
Confederation be mobilized, except Prussia. Bismarck thereupon
played his trump card. &#8220;The Confederation is dissolved!&#8221;
he thundered, and submitted a new draft of articles,
leaving Austria out.</p>

<p>&para; Germany was now in two hostile camps; on came the war.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Thus stood matters on the fateful June 1st, 1866, when
the critical situation in the Danish country offered the match
to touch off the powder magazines against Austria; startled
Austria immediately called upon her beribboned, bejeweled
Frankfort Parliament to declare war on Prussia for insolence;
and this is exactly what Bismarck wished to bring to
pass; it was the moment he had awaited all these long years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Hanover and two other states were asked by telegraph to
declare their intentions. The replies being unsatisfactory,
Bismarck, with supreme daring worthy of Frederick the
Great, orders von Roon and Moltke&#8217;s iron men forward.
They poured like fiends into the surprised territories, overran
them in a night, compelling the flight or capture of three
kings.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;With God for King and Fatherland!&#8221; That old cry is
again heard throughout the Prussian North country. Austria
reckoned stupidly; she had thought Bismarck&#8217;s internal political
dissensions would make it impossible for Prussia to rally
her iron men in good order; but Bismarck knew that while
Liberal leaders quarreled like dogs and cats over Prussian
policies, still when beloved Prussia was in danger, all differences
would be forgotten&mdash;and Prussia in a night would become
an armed camp.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck, that memorable Thursday night, June 14th, 1866,
spent the long hours pacing up and down under the oaks in
the beautiful garden of the Minister of Foreign Affairs; in
deep thought, he awaited the mobilization order from the
King.</p>

<p>Von Moltke, old Roon and Bismarck hold whispered consultations
in which Bismarck is so sure of himself that his mind
at times wanders off war to chatty anecdotes. &#8220;This afternoon,
in the antechamber of the King,&#8221; says Bismarck, &#8220;I
was so weary I fell asleep on the sofa. Is not this garden
fine? Suppose we take a look at the old trees in the park,
behind the palace?&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Berlin rang with the patriotic &#8220;I am a Prussian, know&#8217;st
thou not my colors?&#8221; and in unnumbered thousands the multitudes
pressed around the palace. On the night of the 29th
came the news by telegraph&mdash;&#8220;First blood for Prussia!&#8221;
Berlin goes fairly insane with patriotic joy.</p>

<p>Bismarck leaves the palace at two in the morning; his stern
expression contrasts strangely with the frenzied faces in
the crowd; never did the great man&#8217;s inherent poise show
more clearly, by contrast. The crowds are singing Luther&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
hymn, &#8220;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;A fortress firm in
our God.&#8221; The King comes out on the balcony and returns
thanks. Never-ending cries of triumph force Bismarck to
say a few words from the window of his hotel in the Wilhelms-strasse.
It is a squally, rain-bespattered night, with
the tempest near at hand, but the mobs will not go home.
Suddenly, Bismarck raises his hand, shouts congratulations,
ends by inviting a salute for the King and Prussia.</p>

<p>That very instant a peal of thunder rumbles over the city,
and a trail of forked lightning splits the midnight skies.
&#8220;The very heavens salute Prussia!&#8221; cries Bismarck&mdash;and the
mobs go wild again.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck and his King are off to the front. At Sichrow
they see the corpse-strewn field of glory; 5,000 bodies in all
the agonizing attitudes of sudden death are there before
the master.</p>

<p>William and Otto pass to the field hospital. The wounded
beg for cigars, and Bismarck writes his wife, &#8220;Send cigars
by the thousand, by each courier; also forward copies of the
&#8216;Kreutzzeitung.&#8217;&#8221; This is the official Bismarckian political
organ. So you see, he spreads his political propaganda, even
in the face of death.</p>

<p>&para; Otto winds up his letter with this surprising request, under
date, July 2, Jitschen, &#8220;Send me a French novel to read, but
only one at a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Then came Sadowa, July 3d. The &#8220;Red&#8221; Prince Charles
assigns his troops to battle line at dawn, amidst fog and
rain. At 9, the King and Bismarck appear on the bloody
field. Bismarck rides his tall roan mare &#8220;Verada,&#8221; rechristened
&#8220;Sadowa.&#8221;</p>

<p>In thunder and smoke the battle goes burning on. For hours
the result is in doubt. All depends on the second battle line,
but where is the Crown Prince? Will he arrive in time?</p>

<p>&para; The vast artillery duel began early and lasted many hours.
At the height of the battle, old King William asked for a
cigar, and when the box was brought took a long time to
select one, to his fancy. Bismarck regarded it as a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
sign! &#8220;If he can bother about the best cigar, the battle cannot
be lost,&#8221; was Bismarck&#8217;s mental comment.</p>

<p>&para; At last, the Austrians began giving way.</p>

<p>&para; In joy, the King took from his neck his own Iron Cross and
hung it on Bismarck&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&para; Moltke came up, bright and happy, with these words:
&#8220;Your Majesty has not only won the battle, but the whole
campaign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; It was true; the great Austrian war was practically now
won, and in three short weeks!</p>

<p>&para; Sadowa, or Koeniggraetz as the Germans call it, is one of
the great battles of history. There were 445,000 men engaged;
Austria lost 30,000 and 1,147 officers.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck, on his tall roan, was eighteen hours in the saddle;
neither man nor faithful beast had food or drink, except
that the horse, standing now and again among the windrows
of corpses, ate corn-tops and nibbled at leaves. That night,
Bismarck slept by the roadside, without straw, a carriage
cushion under his head. The rain beat down in a drizzle,
and for miles the smoke hung like a pall. Bismarck&#8217;s rheumatic
pains, his weakness from loss of food, wore him down.</p>

<p>&para; At last, the course of nature can no farther go; and the
master falls into a deep sleep&mdash;surrounded by windrows of
the dead.</p>

<p>&para; At dawn, as he stood up, half-dead from exhaustion, against
the lowering skies he saw the vultures ready to pick the
bones that Glory had provided in this phase of the terrifying
story of German Unity.</p>

<p>&para; The hour of victory again proved Bismarck&#8217;s astuteness.
The fire-breathers around the King urged that the Prussians
march on Vienna and lay the city in waste; Austria could
not prevent; she was prostrate; but Bismarck said no; and
as usual, he had an object. Part of his far-seeing plan was
to take advantage of this psychological moment to conclude
secret treaties with the smaller states, as allies of Prussia,
in case of future wars. It was the forerunner of his last
great work, many years later, the Triple Alliance.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Alas, poor human nature! The rejected stone now

<p>&para; It goes to show that the right man can bring about any
idea, whether to do it makes it necessary to turn Time&#8217;s
clock backward or forward.</p>

<p>Bismarck is magnificent because his extraordinary political
work inspired and carried a new National faith that forced

was ended, he who had been despised as the arch tyrant of

<p>&para; After the Austrian war the deputies whom Bismarck had
fought granted immunity to Bismarck for those four turbulent
years of unconstitutional rule; the overjoyed people
readily forgave him for exacting 12,000,000 thalers for the
secret war chest.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The millions who had looked on him as a madman now
hailed him as little under the stature of a demigod, loaded
him with estates, gold, diamonds, medals, stocked his cellars
with the choicest vintages, sent him train-loads of presents,
thousands of felicitations on parchments done up with blue
ribbons, threw up their hats in frenzy only to see his rattling
old coach pass along the streets of Berlin; and in the National
excitement to do something or say something that
nobody had ever thought of, became as children to the extent
of offering presents to Bismarck&#8217;s dogs.</p>

<p>Also, in the grand distribution of Austrian prize money,
Bismarck was awarded $300,000. With this unexpected good
fortune he bought Varzin estate in Pomerania.</p>

<p>&para; Of late years, his unpopularity has been made clear in a

life was demanded more than once, by assassins. But now

Bismarck hairbrushes, and one came across such advertisements

each sticks so fast that once either gets a hold it is
impossible to get away from it.&#8221;</p>

scroll composed of bottles of raspberry brandy, with handsome
labels, bordered with the German colors, red, white and
black; a Bavarian organ builder forwarded a huge organ;
the inhabitants of Stanaitschen, a gigantic whip; plovers&#8217;
eggs came from the people of Jever; the King of Prussia

<p>&para; But this was only the beginning. At the Universal Exposition

the beautiful display, and one of the exhibitors, bowing
politely, asked the stranger to accept a magnificent diamond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
ring. &#8220;Your Highness knows very well that he cannot
deceive me! I respect your Highness&#8217; desire to remain
incognito, but your fame has preceded you!&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain the stranger protested. The ring was passed, the
exhibitor was highly pleased, the stranger offered a card,
&#8220;Alexander Schnabel, Bavaria.&#8221; The exhibitor still smiled,
saying, &#8220;I respect your Highness&#8217; incognito!&#8221; The stranger
then quickly disappeared in the crowd. What is that shouting
over yonder? &#8220;Hurrah for Count Bismarck! He comes!
He comes!&#8221; In a moment, the diamond merchant saw it all.
He had been cruelly deceived, and furthermore had deceived
himself!</p>



<h5><a name="s52" id="s52"></a>52</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Strange superstition ingrained in this Bismarck
mind; what ikon do you believe in, as you urge to
duty and glory?</p></div>

<p>&para; In this life, each man has, secretly or openly, some ikon
against which to charge, by way of explanation, his personal
history.</p>

<p>In the story of Bismarck many ikons have been used by
many writers, to account for the puzzle of this great man&#8217;s
complex career.</p>

<p>Some call it ambition; others will power; others destiny.
Certainly, in his long and adventurous career Bismarck was
often close to death.</p>

<p>&para; Now Bismarck himself always had his own peculiar ikon.
He called it God. His speeches for many years before Sadowa,
his protests in behalf of his King, as against the rising
tide of Liberalism, always contained amidst thunders of
political consequence, the name God as the one explanation
of Bismarck&#8217;s history and Bismarck&#8217;s ultimate victory.</p>

<p>&para; If that be true&mdash;and it is not for us to say yes or no, for
we are reporting the man as he is and not the way we
think he should be&mdash;then God was at the bloody field of
Sadowa, on the side of the 221,000 Germans, armed with
needle-guns, and not on the side of the 224,000 Austrians,
armed with old-fashioned muzzle-loaders;&mdash;and the clash of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
445,000 men with tens of thousands left dead on the field,
was the final expression of the will of God.</p>

<p>&para; Thus reasoned Bismarck, and surely he should be the best
authority on the conclusions of his own mind? As a matter
of fact, Bismarck&#8217;s profound belief that God was on his side
but shows Bismarck&#8217;s excess of faith&mdash;the faith that moves
mountains.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It has been said by eminent historians that Bismarck as
the Unifier of Germany had in his mind&#8217;s eye, for many years,
the dream of Empire; and the statement is either true or
false.</p>

<p>&para; These writers call Bismarck the man with the vision, the
seer, the German patriot who saw in an early dream the stirring
plan to which he was to devote his long and arduous life.</p>

<p>&para; You are familiar with the painting by LaFarge, depicting
the boy Napoleon, in the school yard at Brien, walking to
one side, by himself? On his youthful brow is already an
air of strange preoccupation, that cloud of ambition, as an
outward sign that the boy&#8217;s imagination is bodying forth the
heroic deeds of the man, many years hence.</p>

<p>&para; Do not believe it! It is only a poetic fancy, not human life.
Plans such as Bismarck met and carried forth, empires such
as Napoleon founded are not placed constructively before one
in a vision, nor are the complex ramifications attendant upon
their ultimate achievement a matter of pre-vision.</p>

<p>It is only the small mind that plans down to the hair&#8217;s
breadth. Your truly great man, like Bismarck or Napoleon,
takes up life as he finds it, and little by little learns the business
of compelling other men to do his bidding; and always
in this there is a large element left to the hazard of the
die; or to use Bismarck&#8217;s own phrase just before Sadowa,
&#8220;Now we shall see how the god of battle rolls the iron dice!&#8221;
Your great man rides forth to the battle, prepared to take
instant advantage of circumstances as they may rise.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s idea of United Germany, at least the idea he
always gave to the public, was that the thing might be done,
with and through the power of God.</p>

<p>The word God appears and reappears in connection with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
plan; in his messages, speeches, dispatches, and in his private
letters, he calls on God. I am not here to say that Bismarck
had religious visions. I take it that he never heard mysterious
voices or saw ghostly forms, but instead was an intensely
human man who fought out his life even as you fight
out yours&mdash;with the powers with which you are endowed,
and for such ends as seem worth the price, to you. The religious
faith learned at his mother&#8217;s knee, made Bismarck&#8217;s
life-work a sacred vocation. He believed that he was chosen
by God to educate, guide and discipline the German people.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;My dear professor, whoever has once looked into
the breaking eye of a dying warrior on the battlefield,
will pause ere he begins war.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&para; And now we meet Bismarck back in Berlin wearing his
Koeniggraetz military cross, suspended by a ribbon around
the collar of his plain blue Prussian uniform. But the great
strain of the years is beginning to show. For one thing Bismarck&#8217;s
eyes are failing; he uses a glass as he muses over
his mounds of state papers; his face is lined with deep marks;
care has done its work; our Otto is now bald, obese and stiff-jointed,
much more so than his 54 years might seem to call
for. In making speeches he does not speak as boldly, as directly
as in days of yore. He stops, hesitates, stammers,
but manages to hold the crowd.</p>

<p>&para; You see he has a world of things on his mind; the under-play
of the great political game absorbs his very life. What,
pray, about this subconscious impression, that everybody has
about an impending war with France? Bismarck, as deep
as the sea, is still seemingly as open as a child.</p>

<p>One day, a famous professor made the fateful inquiry as had
hundreds of journalists&mdash;and this time Bismarck replied, &#8220;My
dear professor, whoever has once looked into the breaking
eye of a dying warrior on the battlefield, will pause ere he
begins a war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; So much for the astuteness of the man with the iron cross.
He is indeed no longer learning the game.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Already Bismarck was thinking of great armaments
against France; for she was now demanding territorial compensations,
as between Prussia and Austria. We find in the
&#8220;Revue Modern,&#8221; August, 1865, this striking interview with
Bismarck, by the French writer, Vilbort:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;About 10 p.&nbsp;m. we were in the study of the Premier, when
M. Benedette, the French Ambassador, is announced. &#8216;Will
you take a cup of tea in the salon?&#8217; M. de Bismarck said to
me, &#8216;I will be yours in a moment.&#8217; Two hours passed away;
midnight struck; one o&#8217;clock. Some twenty persons, his family
and intimate friends, awaited their host.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;The tiny cloud on the horizon as yet had no name, but this
cloud hung to the west across the Rhine.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;At last he appeared, with a cheerful face and a smile upon
his lips. Tea was taken; there was smoking and beer, in
German fashion. Conversation turned, pleasantly or seriously,
on Germany, Italy and France. Rumors of a war with
France were then current for the tenth time in Berlin. At
the moment of my departure, I said: &#8216;M. le Ministre, will you
pardon me a very indiscreet question? Do I take war or
peace with me back to Paris?&#8217; M. de Bismarck replied, with
animation: &#8216;Friendship, a lasting friendship with France! I
entertain the firmest hope that France and Prussia, in the
future, will represent the dualism of intelligence and
progress.&#8217; Nevertheless, it seemed to us that at these words
we surprised a singular smile on the lips of a man who is
destined to play a distinguished part in Prussian politics,
the Privy Councillor Baron von &mdash;&mdash;. We visited him the
next morning, and admitted to him how much reflection this
smile had caused us. &#8216;You leave for France tonight,&#8217; he replied;
&#8216;well, give me your word of honor to preserve the secret
I am about to confide to you until you reach Paris? Ere
a fortnight is past we shall have war on the Rhine, if
France insists upon her territorial demands. She asks of
us what we neither will nor can give. Prussia will not cede
an inch of German soil; we cannot do so without raising
the whole of Germany against us, and, if it be necessary,
let it rise against France rather than ourselves.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The treasonable speech of the Baron did not, however, bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
fruit &#8220;in a fortnight,&#8221; but Bismarck knew the great political
game well, and everything served him in his German undertakings.
We shall see.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The curtain falls in triumph on another spirited act
in the great drama &#8220;Germania.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&para; The political fruits of Sadowa may be summed up in a few
sentences. We clear the air for the grand finale, at the
palace of the French kings at Versailles, four years later.</p>

<p>&para; By the Prague treaty, August 23, 1866, Austria consented
to the reconstruction of the Federation and retired from the
scene.</p>

<p>Bismarck saw that the large states beyond the River Main,&mdash;Bavaria,
Wuertemberg, Baden and South-Hesse, were not
yet ready for his new North German Confederation; but he
would bring them in&mdash;somehow&mdash;later! As for Hanover,
Hesse-Cassel, Frankfort, and Schleswig-Holstein, they were
now mapped with Prussia, their crime being this, that they
had opposed Prussia in a half-hearted way, before Sadowa.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck now set up his popular Prussian Constitution.
Wonder of wonders! Really, it differed not in essentials from
the hated Liberal Constitution that he had assailed so vigorously
in 1848. Also, up to 1866, the Unifier of Germany had
as we have seen always appeared as an opponent of the National
German party. When, however, he had become its
leader, through the great politico-military struggle, he
brought about the results vainly fought for by the patriots
in the revolution of 1848. The distinction was that in the
Revolutionary days, the King would have been obliged to
stoop to the gutter for a &#8220;people&#8217;s crown,&#8221; whereas now he
need do no such humiliating thing. The two wars had proven
William monarch &#8220;by Divine right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; However, a blaze of aristocratic honors at the hands of
King William pleased Bismarck more than he was willing
to admit. Count Bismarck, one night, when the people came
with the torchlights, sounded the old German keynote in a
new way, as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; &#8220;We have always belonged to each other as Germans&mdash;we
have ever been brothers&mdash;but we were unconscious of it. In
this country, too, there were different races: Schleswigers,
Holsteiners, and Lauenburgers; as, also, Mecklenburgers,
Hanoverians, Luebeckers, and Hamburgers exist, and they
are free to remain what they are, in the knowledge that
they are Germans&mdash;that they are brothers. And here in
the North we should be doubly aware of it, with our Platt
Deutsch, which stretches from Holland to the Polish frontier;
we were also conscious of it, but have not proclaimed it until
now. But that we have again so joyfully and vividly been
able to recognize our German descent and solidarity&mdash;for
that we must thank the man whose wisdom and energy have
rendered this consciousness a truth and a fact, in bringing
our King and Lord a hearty cheer. Long live His Majesty,
our most gracious King and Sovereign, William the First!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; A cheer resounded throughout the castle-yard.</p>

<p>&para; The new Constitution gave to the people manhood suffrage
and a popular Assembly. The King of Prussia was made
President of the new Federation, but not its sovereign.
Prussia ruled in her own way, henceforth, but the fiction of
the King, as President, served to steady the minor disgruntled
German princelings, who were led to believe that
their councils were still reckoned with in great affairs. However,
the voting was so arranged that Prussia controlled, off-hand,
17 out of 48 units in the new political Confederation&mdash;and
in a pinch Bismarck could rely on having the desired
majority.</p>

<p>&para; Some say that Bismarck was influenced by the socialist
Lasalle to make concessions to the people, of a piece with
the concessions which in &#8217;48 Bismarck had fought because
they sprang from revolutionists; but the liberal aspects of
the new Constitution served to place the great dream of
German Unity on a firmer basis than would otherwise have
been possible. Bismarck was learning this: To try to choke
the current of public opinion is folly; the wise man, instead,
aims to direct the waters to his own advantage.</p>

<p>&para; The North German Confederation comprised 22 states and
Bismarck was made Chancellor. The Constitution was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
adopted February 24th, 1867. For all practical purposes,
the German Empire was now a fact.</p>

<p>&para; But more work was still to be done, by way of bloody
Gravelotte, Metz, Mar-la-Tour, St. Privat, Woerth, Spichern
Heights, Sedan, and the Siege of Paris.</p>

<p>&para; Corpses, corpses everywhere, lying in windrows miles long!</p>



<h5><a name="s55" id="s55"></a>55</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The master uses the masses as the gardener utilizes
manure&mdash;fertilizing the soil with blood and bones!</p></div>

<p>&para; Bismarck knows that to demand in an emphatic way is the
surest way of receiving. He is always studying men, looking
ahead to the time of the inevitable French war. He is
asking himself, concerning various monarchs of adjacent
nations, opposed to Prussia: &#8220;On which side will he be?&#8221;
&#8220;Is he weak?&#8221; &#8220;Can he be relied on to stand on my side?&#8221;
&#8220;Is he dangerous?&#8221; &#8220;Will he take a bribe?&#8221; &#8220;At any rate,
give him what he wants&mdash;but let me do it in such a way that
he thinks he is forcing us to do what he wants, whereas we
know how to make him actually demand our own terms!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Thus Bismarck without histronic talent, with his piping
voice and his prohibitory bulk for heroic theater-roles, is at
heart the great actor-manager of his time. Instead of creating
parts, he deals them out.</p>

<p>&para; He goes through this world during these trying times
finding the best men to do his own bidding in the coming
war. And when he is hissed down by those who will not
acknowledge his right he breaks their power by defying them&mdash;as
the hurricane scatters the clouds, nor asks permission.</p>

<p>&para; They say that had he lost the Austrian war, he would have
gone to the gallows. Can a Man of Destiny lose?</p>

<p>&para; A new era is dawning. The old worn-out system for a disunited
Germany of 39 jealous states is to be swept away.</p>

<p>&para; For thirty years he dreamed of the inevitable German
Union, had his visions of that glory. He was greater than
himself in those black hours before the Parliament, for four
long years thundering for his side;&mdash;with public opinion flat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
against him, and with mutterings on part of angry mobs that
would bring the rope and hang Bismarck to the highest tree.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Throughout Germany, distressed as her people had been
for years past by political and social miseries, a growing
consciousness of brotherhood, blood and language was at
last about to be politically realized.</p>

<p>Even Napoleon the Little, political fool that he was in many
respects, at least had one idea that showed his common
sense. However, in his day he was laughed out of court for
his &#8220;theory of nationality,&#8221; that is to say, he believed that
people speaking a common language and living in contiguous
territory, have an inalienable right to a common flag.</p>

<p>&para; Now that is precisely what German poets had in mind,
in their romantic way, when for well-nigh 100 years past
they had been dreaming of a united Fatherland&mdash;</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s work, raw as it may seem in many respects, was
consecrated to the great central idea that the German race
is one, or as the poet Freiligrath puts it in one of his stirring
lines, &#8220;Das deutsche Volk ist Eins!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The whole thing comes down to the inner meaning of the
word &#8220;patriotism.&#8221; Tolstoi calls patriotism a frightful vice;
Washington regarded patriotism as a virtue of virtues.</p>

<p>&para; Take your choice.</p>

<p>&para; He is even now brooding over the element necessary for
the perpetuation of a free and United Germany. He reads
his Bible and prepares for the French war.</p>

The blood of the peasantry manured the ground, out of which
was to grow the harvest.</p>

<p>&para; Volumes have been written to explain the origin of the
Franco-Prussian war, and the intricate and inter-related
facts are gone over again and again, now with emphasis here,
again on the other side.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It is trite to say that Bismarck foresaw that a war with
France was inevitable. Behind this simple statement is a
world of intrigue and ambition. The French still hold that
the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was the price not of war
but of Bismarck&#8217;s brigandage. The French also believe that
the candidacy of Prince Leopold Hohenzollern for the Spanish
throne was a Prussian intrigue against France. The
controversy on these points will never be settled, till the
Doomsday Book is opened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; When Bismarck sees that his work of unifying Germany
cannot be completed without another war, the war comes!</p>

<p>His amazing insight into complex political, military and
historical situations, in which with a few words he is able
to divert public opinion to his own peculiar view, has been
shown never with more diabolical cunning than at the time
of the breaking out of the Franco-Prussian war. We refer
here to the &#8220;Ems dispatch,&#8221; that played a startling part in
bringing on the war; but the telegram, in itself, was really
a simple thing.</p>

<p>&para; For four years, Germany had been increasing her military
power by ten-fold. The greatest military martinet of all
time, Von Roon, had the men up at three and four in the
morning drilling them as human beings were never drilled
before. Von Moltke, &#8220;with the battle pictures in his brain,&#8221;
was planning every detail against France.</p>

<p>&para; The preparations were now complete. The Germans were
thoroughly organized, led by generals guided by a single
brain, von Moltke, master of tactics and strategy.</p>

<p>&para; Just the day the war broke out von Moltke, who was always
as taciturn as the Sphinx, &#8220;and in times of peace ugly and
crabbed,&#8221; was sitting in his garden moodily declaiming
against these poor times&mdash;with no war in sight!</p>

<p>Bismarck greeted his compatriot, bravely. Von Moltke ordered
sherry punch and the two cronies began drinking each
other&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;You are not looking well, Chief?&#8221; began Bismarck.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;No, I have not been well, lately!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;But you must cheer up. War is your business and you
will now quickly mend. I remember when the Spanish war
was the burning question you looked at least ten years
younger. When I told you that the Hohenzollern prince gave
the thing up, you became at once ten years older. This time,
the French have made difficulties, and you look fresh and
younger by ten years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; In this light-hearted way Bismarck spoke of the oncoming
strife&mdash;up to the year 1914 the bloodiest in the history of
the world.</p>

<p>&para; Up to 1914, there never was such a disciplined army since
the world began! Neither Napoleon, C&aelig;sar nor Alexander
ever had a power like the United German swarm, now numbering
1,200,000 men, counting advance and reserve; however,
the total strength was never called, as the war was
practically over in seven weeks.</p>

<p>The hosts of Germany, 800,000 strong, helmeted, machine-like,
moved silently and swiftly toward the Rhine, carrying
their trusty needle-guns which had done such destruction
at Koeniggraetz. As they marched they sang the war songs
of their race, and swore to guard the Rhine.</p>

<p>&para; The King immediately left for the seat of war, Mayennce
being the first headquarters of the royal party. Bismarck
was always close to the King.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck had been only a few days in the field when his
health began to improve. Like von Moltke, Bismarck looked
ten years younger.</p>

<p>The old-time biliousness and vein-swelling from which he
suffered, now passed away; the irritability vanished; he was
cool and collected.</p>

<p>&para; He was attended throughout the war by a corps of cipherers,
decipherers, cooks, privy counsellors, secretaries, and
couriers. Faithful Dr. Busch, head of the Bismarck press-agency,
was one of the busiest men of the hour. Bismarck,
who learned the power of the press in shaping public opinion,
kept Busch constantly employed sending out telegrams, giving
the German side of the war.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p><hr />

<p>&para; The Chancellor wore the white uniform of Heavy Landwehr
Cavalry, with white cap and top boots.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck and his staff camped along the line of advance,
wherever night fell&mdash;sometimes in the ch&acirc;teau of a French
nobleman, again in the hut of a French peasant. The company
ate at a common table, and had the same fare. Bismarck
was called &#8220;Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Often the table was made by taking doors off their hinges
and placing them on barrels or boxes; then waiters spread
the cloth and brought out pewter plates and huge tumblers
of a silver-like metal, lined with gilt.</p>

<p>Candles were stuck in empty wine bottles. Thus the great
man worked during the war, week after week.</p>

<p>Dr. Busch, although a very busy man, managed to gather two
volumes of table talk, minute details of what Bismarck said,
ate, drank, preached, the whole set forth in spirited style,
affording an intimate picture of the Iron Chancellor to which
all historians are henceforth under obligations.</p>

<p>&para; Firing was going on around the royal party, often dangerously
near by, and now and then a battle would take place
close to where the King was encamped, with his faithful
minister. They would ride out, to see the fight. Bismarck
read dispatches, made notes, talked to His Majesty, gave
instructions on state matters, counseled with von Moltke on
military matters, received visits, and studied maps. This
continued all day and sometimes all night.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Germans drink 2,500,000 bottles of champagne at
Rheims&mdash;Bismarck&#8217;s ironical revenge!</p></div>

<p>&para; The high tension of war was relieved by amusing episodes,
from day to day. In the evening of the arrival at Rheims,
Bismarck humored himself trying various brands of champagne.
Word was brought that the day before a squadron
of Prussian hussars had been fired on from a leading hotel.
Bismarck ordered that the house should at once be torn down
and the landlord sent to prison; but when it was explained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that none had been injured, Bismarck waggishly decided to
let the landlord off if he would give 2,500 bottles of champagne
to the squadron&mdash;an obligation which the man quickly
proceeded to settle.</p>

<p>&para; The Prussians drank, in and around Rheims, some 2,500,000
bottles of champagne; and, for that matter, the highways
all the way to Paris were marked with long lines of empty
bottles!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Thus Bismarck had his ironical revenge on France; took
his cherry brandy or his champagne as he pleased, while
the great war waged.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; &#8220;Verily, in all history,&#8221; wrote Carlyle to the London Times,
&#8220;there is no instance of an insolent unjust neighbor that ever
got so complete, instantaneous and ignominious a smashing
down, as France now got from Germany.&#8221; The whole civilized
world looked on in amazement.</p>

<p>&para; France had declared war July 15th, and the crushing defeat
at Sedan came September 1.</p>

<p>However, it took seven months before Bismarck was satisfied
that the final papers were drawn to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>Louis Napoleon being a prisoner of war, had lost his throne;
and consequently Bismarck insisted that any peace made
with France would have to be ratified by some central authority.
It is a long, interesting story, but Bismarck finally
won his point.</p>

at the crowning victory of Koeniggraetz, in the Austrian
war, likewise it was now his destiny to be a spectator at the
two battles that decided the issue of the French war, Gravelotte
and Sedan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>The spoils were immense, the glory set Germany in flames.
Bismarck, von Roon and von Moltke were held to be the
greatest men of all time.</p>

<p>&para; Gravelotte, the bloodiest battle of the campaign, engaged
333,000 men and 1,362 cannon. The King commanded in
person, on the right, and Bismarck was with him.</p>

<p>The carnage was frightful. Bismarck busied himself carrying
water to the wounded. When the sun went down, German
victory was complete, at the loss of every tenth man!</p>

<p>&para; That night, Bismarck bivouacked on the battlefield, amidst
serried ranks of the dead. Says one who saw the terrifying
scene: &#8220;Anon, the watchfires of the Prussians blazed round
about; and worn out by incredible exertions at last Bismarck
fell asleep, among the living and the dead. He was now to
have evidence of the result of his life-long ambition; he had
plunged his country into three great wars, with all their
dreadful toll of human life; but he slept that night the sleep
of the just&mdash;because he saw, in the complex blending of his
ideas, no inconsistency in paying any price for the glory of
his country.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The whole bloody day at Gravelotte Bismarck had nothing
to eat. Finally, he found a hen&#8217;s nest with five eggs; giving
three to half-starving soldiers near by, Bismarck with his
sword broke the shells of the two remaining and sucked the
eggs.</p>

<p>Next morning he had some sausage soup, the first warm
food that had passed his lips for 36 hours.</p>

<p>&para; While he was standing dismounted, a concealed French battery
began a tremendous cannonade; the shells dropping all
around, exploded, and plowed up the ground.</p>

<p>&para; Night again. Nothing to eat. A sutler had some miserable
rum and wine. Bismarck took that, at once, but there was
not a morsel to eat. In the village, a few cutlets were found
after a hard search, just enough for the King.</p>

<p>His Majesty decided not to bivouac among the dead again,
but took shelter at a little public house.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck with General Sheridan set off to find a sleeping
place. House after house was filled with the wounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally they found three empty beds with straw mattresses.
Here Bismarck and General Sheridan took up their quarters
and slept capitally.</p>

<p>Sheridan was present as official observer for the United
States Army. In his life, he had seen many great battles,
including Gettysburg and Sedan.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck talked to Sheridan in English; and at dinner they
drank champagne and porter, Bismarck&#8217;s favorite beverage.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; With tens of thousands of Cuirassiers as companions the
King and Bismarck rode down the broad highways, toward
Paris; Bismarck wore his famous big top-boots.</p>

<p>What a picture the King, Bismarck and von Moltke marching
down the highways of France, at their back their almighty
army, up to 1914 the greatest in all history, its fighting
strength 600,000 men, perfectly drilled and armed with
deadly needle-guns. In puffs of smoke the reign of Napoleon
the Little was ending; and it is now curious to recall that,
50 years before, as a young lieutenant, the present King of
Prussia had traversed almost the identical route with the
Allies, to help defeat Napoleon the Great!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The iron heel of war was grinding men&#8217;s lives into the
dust, setting fire to the country, and leaving a trail of destruction.</p>

<p>France looked along the German route as though a cyclone
had devastated the face of nature.</p>

<p>&para; Past cities, towns, vineyards, ch&acirc;teaux, the tramp, tramp,
tramp; the roll of the war drums; the rumbling of wheels&mdash;so
the terrible Prussians marched on!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Summer was passing,&#8221; says Lowe, &#8220;Autumn was coming
fast; France had turned from the sap green of the vineyards
to the golden hues of the harvest; but it was the harvest of
Death.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Now came a gigantic cavalry movement, to the right, a
prodigious wheel, to round-up the French MacMahon, who had
dodged and doubled in the basin of the Meuse. &#8220;The chase,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>&#8221;
said Bismarck, &#8220;reminds me of a wolf hunt in the Ardennes,
but when we arrived, the wolf had vanished!&#8221;</p>

<p>To make common ground with Bazaine, MacMahon concentrated
his troops, with the idea of breaking the siege of Metz,
where 175,000 French soldiers were undergoing the horrors
of starvation.</p>

<p>The Germans outwitted MacMahon, who finally decided to
make a last stand around the frontier fortress of Sedan.</p>

<p>&para; On the night of August 31, the Germans closed in on him,
in what proved to be one of the momentous battles in the
world&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>Von Roon and Moltke had 121,000 infantry and 618 cannon,
the French 70,000 of all arms, 320 cannon and 70 Mitrailleuses.</p>

<p>On the slopes of Frenois, the Prussian King, Bismarck and
a brilliant retinue witnessed for ten hours the dreadful carnage
reddening the fields.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;More artillery!&#8221; cried the King, surprised that the French
would not yield.</p>

<p>In the King&#8217;s retinue stood Bismarck, a crowd of princes,
dukes, aide-de-camps, marshals, besides army attaches of
Russia, England and America.</p>

<p>&para; On the King&#8217;s order, 600 German guns began drawing the
most terrific artillery fire in the history of battles, concentrating
an ever-narrowing circle of flame and shell around
the doomed place. It was too much for flesh and blood; a
white flag was hoisted.</p>

<p>The Prussian flag of truce to inquire for the commander,
was led into the presence of Napoleon, trapped at Sedan!</p>

<p>&para; Moltke&#8217;s terms were short; the whole French army was to
surrender as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The French regarded this as too severe after their heroism,
but the Prussians were inexorable; an armistice left the final
decision till daylight.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck passed the night at the house of Dr. Jeanpot, at
Donchery, a few miles from the bloody field of Sedan.</p>

<p>Along about daybreak, a servant awakened Bismarck, telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
him a French general was at the door. It was Reille, Napoleon&#8217;s
messenger, saying &#8220;Napoleon is on the way over to
see the King of Prussia!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; What a moment! How Bismarck&#8217;s pride must have risen;
how he must have gritted his wolf&#8217;s teeth and felt his gorge
rise as he realized that the hour of his life-long revenge was
at hand, against his old enemy.</p>

<p>&para; And yet, that night, he had been reading in his room after
the dreadful Sedan carnage&mdash;what do you think? Human
inconsistency! &#8220;Daily Refreshment for Believing Christians,&#8221;
by the Moravian brotherhood.</p>

<p>&para; Unwashed, breakfastless, Bismarck immediately set out,
his revolver in his belt; down the road Napoleon&#8217;s carriage,
&#8220;evidently a hired one,&#8221; said Bismarck afterwards, recounting
the scene, &#8220;came into view; the Emperor was escorted by
a handful of officers; Napoleon had on his military uniform,
wore white kid gloves, and was smoking a cigarette!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Bowing and asking His Majesty&#8217;s pleasure, Napoleon asks
Bismarck, &#8220;I wish to meet the King of Prussia.&#8221; Bismarck
replies, &#8220;Unfortunately impossible; the King is quartered
some fifteen miles away.&#8221; However, it is only a trick to gain
time. Bismarck has certain powerful reasons why he does
not desire, just then, that Napoleon and William should
meet. We shall see, presently.</p>

<p>&para; Napoleon drives slowly onward, but nearing Donchery
hesitates on account of the crowd; and spying a solitary cottage
near by, asks if he could not remain there.</p>

<p>&para; It is the hut of a weaver of Donchery&mdash;a mean, dirty place&mdash;and
stands about fifteen paces from the high-road, which
is lined with poplars; the house is one-story, yellow, with
four windows, and has a slate roof.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck and Napoleon ascend a rickety, narrow staircase
giving entrance to a gloomy chamber, in which are a deal
table and two rush-bottomed chairs. Here the two men sit
alone for an hour. What a moment in history!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Only a few years before, that is to say, in October, 1865,
Bismarck had sought out Napoleon III, or &#8220;Napoleon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Little,&#8221; and had held a famous political interview; the meeting
at Biarritz found Napoleon filled with ambitions to emulate
the illustrious career of his uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte;
but the secret although well kept did not escape the vision
of Bismarck.</p>

<p>&para; The Iron Chancellor came as a friend, on a pleasant exchange
of diplomatic courtesies, but in secret he was sounding
Napoleon&#8217;s possible attitude in the oncoming Prussian
war, against Austria. The Emperor was completely tricked.
Bismarck talked frankly of the necessity of &#8220;reform&#8221; in the
German Confederation, and Napoleon, whose hobby was that
peoples speaking the same language should be under one
rule, fell in quite naturally with the plan to &#8220;reform&#8221; Prussia.
The Emperor thought that Bismarck had in mind only
certain constitutional changes in Prussia, not dynastic
changes, destroying the European balance of power and preparing
the way for German Unity.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck made clear to the Emperor that, in return for
keeping out of any impending Austrian clash, France would
be rewarded by enlarged boundaries. As an enlightened
egotist, Bismarck felt that it was &#8220;only fair&#8221; to acknowledge
French help with the left bank of the Rhine. It was all
a bluff. But Napoleon, with his hunger to enlarge French
territory, and to appear before France as a sort of second
Napoleon the Great, fell in with the conspiracy. Herein,
the Bismarckian skill at stacking the cards reaches its height.</p>

<p>&para; And now to think that the next meeting of the French
lamb and the Prussian wolf should take place in a weaver&#8217;s
hut, Napoleon stripped of glory and power by the man who
was to &#8220;give&#8221; great lands to France.</p>

<p>&para; The Emperor had been caught in his own trap; his armies
had been crushed; his government destroyed by Bismarck&#8217;s
genius for political intrigue. The rise to power of Prussia
over Austria, against which Napoleon had been tricked not
to protest, was a turning point in the history of modern
Europe. Hence we say that these two contrasted interviews,
the one of glory, the other of the downfall, Biarritz and the
Weaver&#8217;s Hut, show our Otto von Bismarck as the supreme
politico-military genius of his time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; A curious sidelight on the famous interview at Biarritz is
supplied by Bismarck&#8217;s writings. &#8220;Napoleon said things
could not go on as they had been doing, in Prussia,&#8221; wrote
Bismarck, &#8220;otherwise there would soon be an uprising in
Berlin and a revolution in the whole country. I told him
that the people of our country were not barricade-builders,
and that in Prussia revolutions were made only by the kings.
If the King could stand the strain on him for three or four
years he would certainly win the game. Unless he got tired
and left me, I would not fail him. The Emperor at that time
said of me, &#8216;Ce n&#8217;est pas un homme serieux,&#8217; (Bismarck is
not a serious man), a mot of which I did not think myself at
liberty to remind him, in the weaver&#8217;s hut, at Donchery.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck exercised all his mighty ingenuity to keep Napoleon
from urging too far that the King of Prussia be brought
forward. Bismarck knew that King William was tender-hearted,
and, tempted by the disaster that had come to Napoleon,
would in consequence be inclined to deal leniently
with the Emperor.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck, setting his iron jaws hard, determined then and
there to keep the Prussian King out of it till the terms of
peace had been arranged.</p>

<p>&para; Come, come, are we not justified in our character study of
Bismarck? Who now is master, who now servant? Who
now is shown to be the real power behind the throne? And
if Bismarck did not actually bring on this awful war, then
he well knew the art of making other nations declare war.
Oh, he has learned a thing or two in his long and eventful
life; and he is now about to create his diplomatic masterpiece&mdash;in
the Belgian weaver&#8217;s hut.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Sedan surrendered 40 generals, 2,825 various other officers,
83,000 prisoners of war, 184 pieces of artillery, 350 field guns,
70 Mitrailleuses, 12,000 horses, and enormous quantities of
military stores.</p>

<p>&para; The broken-hearted Emperor was sent away to the castle
at Wilhelmshoehe, near Cassel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>And the King of Prussia opened the champagne at his royal
headquarters at Vendresse, and toasted von Roon, Moltke
and Bismarck: &#8220;You, General von Roon, whetted our sword;
you General von Moltke, wielded it; and you, Count Bismarck,
have brought Prussia to its present prominence by the way
in which you have directed its policy for several years.&#8221;</p>



<h5><a name="s60" id="s60"></a>60</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In which Bismarck reaches the zenith of his stupendous
career; diplomatist, ministerial C&aelig;sar, unifier
of his country.</p></div>

<p>&para; The Iron Chancellor held firmly to his plan to strip France
of her last franc.</p>

<p>The siege of Paris continued, with Bismarck and the King
of Prussia installed at Versailles, within the shadow of the
stately palace of the Kings of France.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It is a long, vivid story leading to the 5,000,000,000 francs
indemnity, and the cessation of Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>M. Thiers treated in vain to get softer terms; but Bismarck
kept the King out of it and stuck to his hard bargaining.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;This is not war, it is confiscation!&#8221; Thiers exclaimed one
day in terrible anger, and eloquently he parleyed to have the
amount reduced.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck thereupon began to talk in German!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I have not enough French to answer such a charge as you
have just made!&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;Henceforth, we carry on
our affairs in German.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; M. Thiers threatened to appeal to Europe to intervene, but
at this Bismarck broke into a hoarse laugh.</p>

<p>He knew that he had in his pocket a secret quit-claim from
Russia and Italy, Denmark and Belgium were tied in another
way, Spain was hostile to the French, and as for England&mdash;he
snapped his fingers!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Defy me, and I tell you what I will do! We have in Germany
about 100,000 excellent French troops, captured at
Metz, who are still wholly devoted to the old Imperial cause.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
I will release them and bring back the Bonapartists! I care
not who is in power so long as the proper sovereign government
of France signs our peace demands for indemnity.
Napoleon cannot do it, as his throne is in ruins; and even
if he did, the next party in power would probably set it
aside. So part of my duty is not only to demand for my
King the just rewards of our victory, but to start France
again with some new form of government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Going behind this stern diplomatic language, what Bismarck
really meant was this: &#8220;The longer the French Assembly
hesitates to call an election the more we will starve
the city into submission. Live on horseflesh, stale bread,
cats and dogs!&mdash;die of fever and pestilence!&mdash;the sooner it
is over! Our siege guns will continue to bark night
and day, Paris will be reduced to ashes, crumble to ruins,
but the demands of the Prussian King must be obeyed.
No power on this earth can turn me from my project. I am
resolved to wage a war of extermination&mdash;and I have
spoken!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Very well, then!&#8221; exclaimed M. Thiers, &#8220;M. le Comte, as
you will! Rob us of our homes!&mdash;provinces!&mdash;burn down our
homes!&mdash;strangle our peaceful inhabitants!&mdash;in a word, complete
your work! We shall fight you as long as our breath
remains. Perhaps we shall die&mdash;but we shall never be dishonored.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck seemed touched, but said all he had to do was to
obey the orders of the King.</p>

<p>Meantime he went out and was closeted again with Moltke
and His Majesty.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I do not believe,&#8221; said M. Favre, &#8220;that any criminal ever
waited for the judgment with more feverish anxiety. Motionless,
we followed with bewildered gaze the hands of the
clock.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;The door opened; Bismarck stood on the threshold, announcing
that he would not insist on the German troops entering
Paris&mdash;provided we gave up Belfort!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;There was a moment of inexpressible agony, but an exchange
of glances sufficed. &#8216;We should be wanting in patriotism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
if we accepted!&#8217; exclaimed M. Thiers. The door
closed and Bismarck disappeared again.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;At eight o&#8217;clock, M. Thiers had reaped the reward of his
heroic endeavors. He had saved Belfort, but in all other
respects he had absolutely failed to move the man of blood
and iron. For five fearful days they had wrestled with the
problem of the 5,000,000,000&mdash;and had lost! Bismarck had
his own banker, the Jew Bleichroder, to show that after all
the indemnity would be adding &#8216;only about one-fourth&#8217; to
France&#8217;s national debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; On Sunday, February 26, the preliminaries of peace were
signed. As Thiers signed, Bismarck took him by the hand,
saying, &#8220;You are the last who ought to have been burdened
by France with this sorrow&mdash;for of all Frenchmen you have
the least deserved it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck, radiant with joy, signed the papers with a new
golden pen sent him for this express purpose by the ladies
of the German town of Pforsheim.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Said M. Favre: &#8220;The countenance of M. de Bismarck was
most happy. With theatrical pomp, he sent for a golden pen....
M. Thiers approached the little table on which lay
the documents; he wrote his name without betraying the feelings
that tortured him. I tried to imitate him, and we withdrew.
The sacrifice was accomplished.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;As a special understanding, it was agreed that the siege
should be lifted that morning at four o&#8217;clock and that France
should fire the last shot.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;What sentiment in this, for Paris! Along then, in the
deep night that precedes the dawn, with the sky illuminated
by occasional flashes of the siege guns, at last the fire lessened,
slackened gradually, and then solemn silence fell. Suddenly,
through the night, a loud report was heard from the
Paris ramparts, followed by a path of fire through the sky;
this immediately died away, and deep silence, now unbroken,
continued.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;The long siege was over!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; On the third day after signing the hard conditions, 30,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
German troops made their triumphal entry into Paris, after
being reviewed on the plain of Longchamps.</p>

<p>With the victorious Prussians, Bismarck rode as far as the
Arc de Triomphe.</p>

<p>&para; It was one of the greatest incidents of his eventful life.</p>

<hr />

<p>We have transposed to the last an episode that took place
January 18th, 1871, the anniversary of the day on which the
first King of Prussia had himself crowned at Koenigsberg,
1701.</p>

<p>In the Hall of Mirrors, at Versailles, King William I of
Prussia was crowned German Emperor, amidst a clash of
arms, martial music, hymns of praise, and the felicitations of
a brilliant throng.</p>

<p>In the semi-circle stood princes, grand dukes, dukes, crown
princes, hereditary princes, generals, ministers, military and
political figures, against a background of Prussian hussars.</p>

<p>&para; The Hall of Mirrors at Versailles had seen many astonishing
sights in the centuries gone by; and doubtless that night
the shades of Richelieu, Louis XIV, Napoleon, Marie Antoinette,
Marie Theresa, Madam Pompadour, looked down on one
of the strangest incidents in all history, a German Emperor
receiving his crown in the very palace of the old French
kings, who in their turn, had waged some twenty hard wars
upon Germany, and more than once had placed some part of
German soil in pawn. Who read the proclamation to the
assembled company expressing the new dignity of the sovereign
over United Germany?</p>

<p>&para; The Man of Blood and Iron, Otto von Bismarck, at last had
demonstrated the dream of his life, that is to say, he had
in truth not only long been King&#8217;s Man, but also long had
upheld the King his master; had unified Germany;&mdash;and now
had made his master more than king, as William I, German
Emperor.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s life work was now practically over; however, he
was a busy man for twenty years to come, trying to settle
Germany&#8217;s perplexing internal problems; but in the Hall
of Mirrors at Versailles he reached the zenith of his stupendous
career as unifier of his country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; In this magnificent state apartment of Louis XIV are seventeen
arcades of looking-glass, corresponding to the seventeen
large windows; the ceiling by Lebrun shows thirty incidents
in the life of Louis the Magnificent, each painting bordered
by rich gilded sculptures.</p>

<p>The entire gallery is decorated with marbles and grand
trophies of gilded copper, by Coysevox.</p>

<p>In Louis&#8217;s time, the gallery was hung in white damask brocaded
with gold; there were orange trees in rare boxes; the
great central chandelier of gilded silver was by famous
smiths; priceless Savonnerie carpets muffled the lightest foot-fall;
round about were silver stools, with green velvet coverings
surrounded by bands of gold brocade. Later, the silver
was melted down, on Louis&#8217;s order, and the money squandered.</p>

<p>&para; These great artists worked in the Hall of Mirrors and
neighboring apartments: Berain, Monsart, Lebrun, Lenotre,
Grissey, Vigarani, Audran, Baptiste, Coustau, Coypel, Van
Cleve, Taffieri, Taupin, Tempore, Temporiti, numbering
among them painters, sculptors, designers, architects, wood
carvers, silversmiths and lockmakers extraordinary.</p>

<p>&para; Here, Louis, surrounded by some 1,500 flatterers of all
degree, high and low, kept his court of pleasure bestowing
ribbons, favors, dinners, golden swords for the men, diamond
necklaces for the women.</p>

<p>&para; However, 1789 ended all that; the mob stormed into imperial
chambers and through the apartments of the old aristocratic
French courtesans; and with clubs, axes and fires
laid in ruin art treasures that stood unmatched through
centuries.</p>

<p>&para; To this Versailles come now the Prussian soldiers to proclaim
their German Emperor; in this palace, where the Bourbons
had expended some 200,000,000 francs, as money is
reckoned today; to say nothing of the free labor of thousands
of convicts.</p>

<p>No record tells what Louis spent on the place, but in August,
1684, 8,000 horses and 20,000 convicts were working there,
and in 1685 at one time as many as 36,000 convicts, in charge
of soldiers, added their vast free labor to heighten the peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
glory of the great French monarchs, as the sublime
representatives of kingcraft&mdash;in its splendor and in its
downfall.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; All hail, William I, German Emperor! All hail, Bismarck!
All hail, United Germany!</p>

<h3>The Versailles Masterpiece</h3>


<h5><a name="s61" id="s61"></a>61</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Kaiser&#8217;s crown at last, and how and why; herein,
we sum up the very flower of our great man&#8217;s
genius; and mark it well!</p></div>

<p>&para; The very name &#8220;Kaiser&#8221; brings up memories of the Middle
Ages, thence backward to the days of imperial C&aelig;sar.
Kaiser, at best, is but C&aelig;sar, rewritten.</p>

<p>Yet Bismarck was at great pains to make clear that the substitution
of Kaiser for King of Prussia involved no restoration
of ancient imperial institutions.</p>

<p>&para; The use of Kaiser, as the title for the new monarch, had
behind it a deep, almost religious purpose, in conformity with
the sense of nationality and brotherhood to which through
long and painful development the German states had at last
attained. Bismarck calls the return of the title &#8220;a political
necessity, making for unity and centralization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I was convinced,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that the pressure solidifying
our imperial institutions would be more permanent the more
the Prussian wearer of the imperial title should himself avoid
that dangerous striving on the part of our dynasty to flaunt
its own pre-eminence in the face of other dynasties. King
William I was not free from this inclination ... to call
forth a recognition of the superior prestige of Prussia&#8217;s
crown, over the Kaiser&#8217;s title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The Kaiser idea is simple: He is the sworn servant &#8220;of&#8221;
the people, but his terms are his own, viz., all is &#8220;for&#8221; the
people, but not &#8220;through&#8221; the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Such in a few words is the Bismarckian conception of a
strong ruler.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; It was not, then, to be &#8220;an expanded Prussia,&#8221; but a German
Empire. And the Kaiser&#8217;s powers are hence the legal
functions of an imperial organ, attached by the organic law
of the Empire to the Prussian crown.</p>

<p>Thus Germany is a true state, but not a monarchy; sovereignty
does not rest with the Kaiser, but with the totality
of the allied governments. And in turn the old states became
provinces of the Empire; and the Kaiser exercises his powers
in the name of the Empire.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; However, it must be recalled that Bismarck always detested
political and social conformity, trampled conformity
under foot, and with wild voice ridiculed conformity&mdash;especially
when conformity meant to yield to the peasants
a constructive share in the governments of the thirty-nine
clashing German states. That is to say, his idea of freedom
was to make the State paramount, guiding, directing and if
need be disciplining the people.</p>

<p>&para; Memories fasten themselves on us, at this moment, memories
of the old days of struggle for nationality.</p>

<p>It was on Bismarck&#8217;s advice that, although Frederick William
IV was bitten by the ambition to become ruler of United
Germany, yet when the democratic Frankfort Diet offered
him the crown, he did indignantly refuse; and many years
later, his successor&mdash;that old man with the wonderful history!&mdash;William
I, after the victories of Sedan and Gravelotte,
was mightily afraid that the Berlin Parliament, representing
democratic conformity, would offer him the honor
of Emperor before that gift could be bestowed by the princes
themselves.</p>

<p>&para; Ludwig of Bavaria in his letter to William, urging the imperial
title, Kaiser, or German Emperor, uses these words:
&#8220;I have proposed to the German princes to join me in urging
Your Majesty to assume the title, German Emperor, in connection
with the exercise of the pr&aelig;dial rights of the Federation.&#8221;
But it was Bismarck&#8217;s masterpiece of politics, equal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to his stroke of Holstein, that sent to the King of Bavaria
the proper diplomatic advices, to be acted upon by the South
German princes and returned to the supposedly surprised
William, urging on him to become German Emperor.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; In spite of Bismarck&#8217;s fine hand, Bavaria at first refused
to accept the Iron Chancellor&#8217;s advices. There is light on
this topic in Herr Ottokar Lorenz&#8217;s &#8220;Foundation of the German
Empire,&#8221; making clear among other facts that &#8220;the German
eagle had a narrow escape from dying in the egg.&#8221;
Twice negotiations were broken off; finally, when the King
of Bavaria tried to get his countrymen behind him in the
plan to proclaim William of Prussia, German Emperor, at
Versailles, &#8220;it was only after some hesitation and much
regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>It took the Bavarian Landtag a month to make up its mind!
To read the heated discussions is to destroy the legend that
the proclamation of the Kaiser was by spontaneous demand.</p>

<p>&para; But we must not press these things too far. The fact that
King William had to fight for the magnificent honor he had
won for himself and his country, is merely to say that men
are men; nor should we ever forget that nothing creates so
much jealousy as prosperity.</p>

<p>&para; Herr Bismarck had the cleverness to win, at last, and after
that there is little to be added.</p>

<p>For that matter, the much-lauded revolt of the American
colonists against Britain was originally not endorsed by over
one-third of the inhabitants. Yet, with the final victory,
like a pack the colonists went over to the winning side, saying,
&#8220;We told you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; We have nothing but praise for the way in which Bismarck
created his Versailles masterpiece. That there was a political
squabble behind the curtain, in Bavaria, was to be expected.</p>

<p>&para; Tell me, did you ever achieve any success that you did not
have to go out and fight for?</p>

<p>It is an amiable fiction that men &#8220;recognize&#8221; each other&#8217;s
work, in politics, and &#8220;urge&#8221; on them rulership over nations.
They, too, have to get out and fight for it!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p><hr />

<p>&para; This necessity for turbulent striving to carry out political
ideas was especially true of Germany during the period
of which we write. Complex conditions long made National
Unity a profound problem, not only in politics but in human
nature.</p>

<p>&para; All manner of blacklegs were at work with here and there
an honest man; national oratory was at once visionary,
ludicrous and tragical; fanatics of the bomb, the knife and the
poison-cup for years were abroad in the land. These situations,
growing from times past, compel you to hold with
Bismarck that ultimate appeal to the sword was after all
the only hope for a new Germany.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck did it grossly, but at least he went through with
it&mdash;call it militarism or what you please.</p>

<p>&para; For that matter, neither Britain, France, Belgium, (nor
the United States with her 186-odd variants of Christianity
in her 186-odd religious sects), grew out of political
cynicism, least of all out of some aloof system of esoteric
idealism.</p>

<p>&para; The King of Britain owes his crown to the sword; the President
of France his high office to the sword; the Belgian King
traces his legitimacy to revolution; likewise, to revolution
the President of the United States owes his right to rule
during his brief hour of official authority.</p>

<p>&para; But what would you in this imperfect world?</p>

<p>German Unity sprang from the needs of human hearts&mdash;fighting
bravely for what they hold important!&mdash;even as you
fight for your rights, or consent to remain a slave. And Germans
never will be slaves.</p>

<p>&para; Therefore, know it now and be done with it, or make the
most of it if you are inclined to snarl at realities: The
Kaiser&#8217;s crown came by the sword. Surely, you did not expect
that it fell from Heaven? As long as men are men,
they must fight for what they achieve; and the German
Empire is no exception;&mdash;nor is there any good reason to
expect that history can possibly be other than the record of
human nature, in action.</p>

<p>&para; Up to his downfall in 1890, Bismarck was an uncompromising
Royalist, scoffed at the common people as a source of
political sovereignty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; No man knows what is, ultimately, for the glory of God;
but when in bitter retirement, thrown off by the grandson
of William I, Bismarck, replying to the old dispute about
the interior causes of the Franco-Prussian war, to which
William owes his title German Emperor, it is a fact that
Bismarck proceeded to weaken the royalist tradition by forcing
the government to produce the Ems dispatch; and it was
then made clear to the common people that there was behind
it all the under-play of politics, thus dispelling the religious
and patriotic glamour that the war had been entered upon to
protect the Fatherland against the land-lust of Napoleon
the Little.</p>

<p>Had now the military right been used not to express the will
of God, but the ends of human expediency?</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck certainly knew all this before the great war, but
for reasons of political expediency suppressed the facts till
in a moment of indignation he dropped the mask and called
on all honest men to know the truth.</p>

<p>Bismarck, twenty years before, had with equal indignation
set up before the Prussians that their King had been grossly
insulted, and that Napoleon wanted the left bank of the
Rhine.</p>

<p>&para; But let us forget all this, in a broad acknowledgment of
the fact that human beings at various times, for their own
ends, do indeed wear various masks; and let us not keep up
the fight forevermore;&mdash;but here and now let us grant to
Bismarck final absolution, not claiming for him the perfection
of the demigod.</p>

<p>&para; After all is said, history is not the record of some far-off
manifest destiny, but instead is merely the sordid story of
human nature in action, reciting at best the littleness that
appertains to men&#8217;s ways, with now and then the unrealized
expression of some fleeting larger hope.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>His Versailles masterpiece reduced to its final analysis,
in terms of human nature; wherein it is made
clear that Bismarck knew his German peasant as
well as his Prussian King.</p></div>

<p>&para; The core of human interest around which Bismarck shaped
his stupendous politico-military drama, in order that, in the
end, William might become German Emperor, was neither an
appeal to parliaments nor to armies, but a reply to a peculiar
psychological something in the Teuton character that makes
respect for the strong hand.</p>

<p>It is only in the largest way that this fact may be made
clear. It escapes categorical statement;&mdash;and can best be
glimpsed behind the history of events, from the psychological
rather than the physical side.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck manipulated an invisible but very real human
force, made it the breath of life for his plans!</p>

<p>&para; That he warped on the Nineteenth Century the old Holy
Roman Empire conception of Divine-right is an amazing
politico-military fact.</p>

<p>It was only after many brilliant achievements that, at the
height of his power, C&aelig;sar linked himself with the gods.
C&aelig;sar&#8217;s earlier life knew no such pretensions, but as he
climbed the dizzy heights of fame, at last the day came
when his kinship with the immortal gods themselves alone
satisfied his inordinate ambitions; and from that time forth
Divine-right became an established fact in the theological-political
code of kings; and thus on, down through the
Middle Ages, until the French Revolution destroyed confidence
in the old-line absolute monarch, as vicegerent of Christ on
this earth.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; However, that Otto von Bismarck, the blond Pomeranian
giant, warped on the Nineteenth Century the Imperial
C&aelig;sarian idea of the Divine-right of kings is not the final
fact of his work. The inner fact is that he urged the King&#8217;s
authority as a foil against the mob-idea of the French Revolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
The liberty-crazed masses needed a strong hand at
this time.</p>

<p>&para; What made possible the coming of the Empire was not,
after all, traceable entirely to the political side of Bismarck&#8217;s
hotly contested struggles.</p>

<p>The innate craving of the German people for a strong ruler
has a subtle inner meaning, too easily overlooked.</p>

<p>&para; In the final analysis, Bismarck&#8217;s position expresses Prussian
sense of National security in a powerful war lord, rather
than supports the conception of master and man. His was
not the position of lord and servant; rather it means a manly,
intelligent admission of the necessity of a strong central
authority in the nation.</p>

<p>&para; By the force of years of tedious repetitions, building on the
plain laws of mental suggestion, Bismarck at last created
certain dominating ideas; but the germ of these ideas already
existed in Prussia&#8217;s consciousness.</p>

<p>The Prussian character supporting Divine-right represents
a singular compound of cadet, blind confidence in aristocratic
leadership, religious radicalism, worship of ancestors approximating
the Chinese sentiment, and finally, a racial psychology
of rulership, based on the rattan of Frederick the Great.
On this total combination, the astute Bismarck played for
thirty long years, warring for his lord and master, the Hohenzollerns.</p>

<p>A careful reading of Bismarck&#8217;s speeches, letters, dispatches,
will show that whatever political expediency he may at various
times have followed, and however often he may have
changed front, there is still in his great labor a tireless repetition
of ideas commanding respect for vested authority, for
ancestry, for a ruling class as against the ruled, and always
for absolute dog-like obedience to some central commanding
power.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The psychological something on which Bismarck builded his
German Empire is Bismarck&#8217;s recognition of the peculiarities
of his German peasant, as well as of his Prussian King. We
come now to some great central racial facts.</p>

<p>Bismarck&#8217;s unending eulogies of military glory, now extolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in the high language of a victorious commander-in-chief,
again as a drill-sergeant sharply criticising the squad, are
not to be dismissed as the expressions of one in large authority,
speaking from the steps of the throne.</p>

<p>Bismarck&#8217;s work would have failed had he not linked it to
some secret craving of the Teutonic heart, far deeper than
conquering the jealousies, intrigues and selfishness that compose
the long story of the rise of the German Empire.</p>

<p>&para; Historians may talk as much as they please about Bismarck&#8217;s
executive and administrative genius, but these, great
as they are, are overshadowed by his power of political spirit-healing,
as it were; through practice of his peculiar psychotherapy
he cured sick Germany of many of her ills; at the
same time bringing about German brotherhood in a way that
added to the great glory of Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; Appealing to the solemn religious side of Prussian character
that expresses itself in upholding authority, in church
or state, Bismarck incessantly lauds the descendants of noble
families, and sets up that Prussian military aristocracy alone
reared up Prussian political legitimacy.</p>

<p>He presents likewise the idea that the supreme quality of
German manhood is courage; and to Bismarck&#8217;s mind the
sovereign German virtue is revealed in strong-willed eager
soldiers.</p>

<p>While in these lofty moods, Bismarck displays enormous
family pride for his beloved aristocrats of Brandenburg, is
never weary of telling of their military prowess.</p>

<p>He avows on many occasions his life-long regret that he did
not enter the army as a career, instead of taking up the civil
service; he digs into his family records and proudly numbers
each Bismarck who carried arms, even down to distant
cousins, and is never so happy as when telling of Bismarcks
on many blood-drenched fields.</p>

<p>Above all else, he everlastingly insists that behind his demands
for his King is the direct will of God.</p>

<p>&para; There is not the slightest doubt that as time passed and Bismarck
kept telling over and over for years that the King
represented God&#8217;s will on this earth, true Prussians came at
last to believe it more and more; for the reason that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in their blood to believe, as it is the nature of a bull-dog to
fight, a glutton to eat, a thief to steal, the sun to shine.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck called on heaven to send its avenging lightnings
on the heads of those who deserted their monarch, to their
perpetual dishonor; could think of no crime more monstrous
than ingratitude to his King, especially to a king by the
grace of God.</p>

<p>And Bismarck declared again and again, as his deepest conviction,
that the Prussian crown was encircled by a heavenly
aureole. In short, Bismarck revived in its purest and most
uncompromising form the doctrine of Divine-right.</p>

<p>&para; In an age seemingly out of touch with this iron-bound mold
of the Feudal past, Bismarck would have failed miserably
were it not that he touched a responsive side of Prussian
character&mdash;dog-like loyalty to authority, compounded of military
glory and a pale shimmering ghost of religious aspiration.</p>

<p>The governing fact of the whole situation was psychological
rather than physical; and all this stupendous cannonading at
Gravelotte, Sedan, Koeniggraetz, and the magnificent drama
in the Hall of Mirrors, were after all merely so many evidences
that Bismarck better than all the tribe of his objectors
knew the psychological core of Prussian character.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck brought down the wrath of God on those rival
leaders who dared to be disloyal to his Divine-right King, and
flew into frenzy at the very thought that a genuine Prussian
should expect wisdom from the common people. Behind all
this, was always the solid appeal to Prussian military-cadet
idea of loyalty and strong politico-religious instincts.</p>

<p>&para; Manipulating this psychological side, invisible yet very real,
Bismarck shows his genius as a constructive statesman.
Without this intuitive touch of Prussian consciousness, all the
lustre that Bismarck ultimately shed on the Imperial crown
would have been impossible.</p>

<p>&para; Thus, we behold Otto von Bismarck, the rude, blond,
Pomeranian giant&mdash;in spite of his coarse speeches, his
brawls, his political card-stacking, his enormous egotism, his
passionate seeking after power&mdash;play with Shakespearian
subtlety on the strings of human passion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no larger character-side to our Bismarck; so study
it well and reflect on its wide meaning.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; We are not here to say what Bismarck should or should
not have done, but we make up our mind about him by what
he did do.</p>

<p>&para; He had peculiar ideas of religion, pleasure, duty, and certainly
he had his own idea of what was best for Prussia,
and finally for Germany.</p>

<p>&para; He bartered his immortal time for a King&#8217;s crown and an
Emperor&#8217;s glory, guns, swords, forts, marchings up and down
the land.</p>

<p>&para; He bartered his time in angry disputes with his fellow-man,
for prisons, broken homes, murders, tears for 80,000
widows and orphans.</p>

<p>&para; He bartered his time for magnificent spectacles such as the
coronation of William I in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles,
a palace outrivaling any creation of man since the days of
Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>&para; He bartered his time for grand balls for aristocrats in silk
coats and ladies in diamonds and satin gowns.</p>

<p>&para; He bartered his time that a certain space in Europe be
made over to his own liking. Other kings and emperors with
equal logic wished to have this space made over in a way
that seemed as good as the one Bismarck had in mind, but
Bismarck regarding it as a calamity that other plans should
come to pass, fought bitterly with sword and cannon to back
his individual opinion against all who disputed with him.</p>

<p>&para; He bartered his time that a certain part of the map be
marked with one name instead of thirty-nine names, as had
been the case when he came to power as a young man in
the politics of Prussia.</p>

<p>&para; And finally he bartered his immortal time in a thirty-years&#8217;
gladiatorial fight that in the end millions of Germans might
feel the tingle of blood-brotherhood. How he faced the long,
heart-breaking battle, therein we find the true measure of
our great Bismarck! Thus his work, as an individual, is
absorbed in the larger life of the German Empire. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
National services make Bismarck one of the immortals; and
his name will be remembered affectionately by Germans for
thousands of years.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The present review of German origins, through Bismarckian
genius, is concerned largely with the form of government
established.</p>

<p>The collective efficiency of the Bismarckian idea, as worked
out in the German Constitution, promptly ascertains the will
of the people, and carries out that will.</p>

<p>&para; The Kaiser, through the Chancellor, has the selection of
all important public officials, and as King of Prussia appoints
Prussian administrative officials; and in turn, the various
kings choose the various public servants in their respective
kingdoms. All hold office during good behavior, or for life;
instantly responsive to the will of the Kaiser, or to the Bundesrath.
The state officials are thus &#8220;the fingers of the
Kaiser,&#8221; working the duties of the Empire, free from the
petty molestations that assail even the most trustworthy and
patriotic American office-holders.</p>

<p>&para; In simple terms of parallel, the much-lauded American
Commission System, for the government of cities, was borrowed
from the Kaiser.</p>

<p>The Commission System delegates the power to a committee
of five, who pass and execute the laws.</p>

<p>This is precisely the principle laid down by the Bundesrath,
in which body is united executive, legislative and judicial
functions. It is a fact that the cities most efficiently managed,
in the United States (1915), are under the Commission
System, that is to say, the German conception of responsible
politico-civic authority.</p>

<p>&para; German thoroughness, as well as German discipline, unite
to make the German system a brilliant success; but in America
the German collective idea is politically offensive because
of our superstition that the way of Liberty lies through incessant
political changes. The American has confidence in
the wisdom of large numbers, believes that by dividing the
functions of government the people may be saved from themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
One-man power is (theoretically) greatly feared, in
America. Despite the fact that in all great industrial undertakings
Americans appreciate the part played by personal
responsibility, they are loath to admit that the principle
makes for National political efficiency.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; One final word: Revolution means change; and in this sense
the French Revolution is important. In some respects, it is
still going forward. However, in 1848 the practical side of
the Revolution was not understood, was therefore decried by
conservative thinkers who saw in the excesses of the Commune
little that heralded a better day.</p>

<p>&para; In France, thousands of men misinterpreted emotional zeal
for human brotherhood for fitness to govern. It is the old,
old story.</p>

<p>To come at once to the point: You must judge a nation as
you do a man, not by what that man says, but by what he
does. Hence, from Bismarck&#8217;s point of view, it was time to
be done with the bursting of blood vessels in a frenzy about
equality, and to come down to the essential facts of human
nature; or if you like the words better, human ways.</p>

<p>It is not necessarily a mark of wisdom to issue &#8220;manifestoes
against special privileges&#8221; and to set up that &#8220;all&#8221; the people
are fit to rule an empire.</p>

<p>The very reverse is the proof of history; few men indeed
there are who have the patience, the discretion and the prudence
to rule over other lives.</p>

<p>Also, the German race asks no upstart rulers; the idea of
father and child, duty, discipline and personal responsibility
is deeply grounded in the German conception of an adequate
State.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; There is small profit in using precious time denouncing
Bismarck&#8217;s protest against French Constitutionalism. Let
us, instead, try to understand why the old ways were cherished.
And always bear in mind that the Past holds mankind
in a tighter grip than the Radicals are willing to concede!
There is no such thing as wiping off the slate and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
starting with a &#8220;new&#8221; set of ideas. The wisest man in the
world cannot do that. At best, he recognizes the past, with
here and there a slight variation.</p>

<p>Such, in short, was Bismarck&#8217;s broad and true idea of human
necessity. And he planned his German Empire accordingly.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck was faced by these facts: the idiomatic ways in
which German people thought and acted; their tastes and
ideals, not only in politics but in society, law, religion;&mdash;nay,
their very dreams. Throughout, there is always a profound
sense of personal responsibility to the State. The State is
not to be forgotten for some spurious personal individuality.</p>

<p>And mark this: that for generations &#8220;events&#8221; in Germany all
gave expression to certain racial habits of thought, against
which all manner of Communistic uprisings were anathema.</p>

<p>German sense of discipline, duty and personal responsibility,
in State affairs, is grounded on a high consciousness that is
not satisfied with half-measures, bungling, waste, cheap
politicians, and freakish legislation. The German takes himself
too seriously to permit a bunko-politician to come on
with faking, as a substitute for the National ideal of
government.</p>

<p>&para; Hence, Bismarck&#8217;s Imperial democracy, with the Kaiser
at its head.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; As between the inevitable contest between the Crowd and
the Crown, springing from the inflammatory ideas of French
Constitutionalism, Bismarck did not shrink; but fought it
out in his own way. Our Man of Blood and Iron desired the
blessings of liberty for Germany with all the strength of
his powerful being; but he could not stultify his common
sense by meekly conceding no essential distinction between
men, in their capacity for leadership. He was, then, intent
on bringing out of the German political chaos a type of
democracy that may be termed Imperial as well as representative,
in which the people are accorded their share, as
he saw it, but always under the guidance of a strong central
authority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; And after all said in glorification of any special type of
government, the stubborn fact remains that absolute equality,
from a representative point of view, is a fiction unsupported
by fact. The notorious incapacity and apathy of the masses
is always, in the end, directed by central powers, exercised
insidiously or openly as you please, but exercised nevertheless.
In every political party we find a coterie, men of little
wisdom it may be but leaders of the crowd; in every city
commission is always one masterful man to whom the other
members defer; in every banking house, one deciding voice;
every religious organization must have a head, regardless of
the number of counsellors; every ship a captain; every army
a general; and, finally, in every family there should be the
guidance and direction of a strong father.</p>

<p>&para; Is there not a ring of sincerity in Bismarck&#8217;s manly
acknowledgment of the inevitable equalities in the human
stuff of which governments are composed? He saw only
common sense in openly protesting that in any German government
big enough and enduring enough to satisfy the
German conception of responsibility, in a word German
thoroughness, there must be, somewhere, a master-mind.</p>

<p>&para; For many years, and even today, Bismarck is in some
quarters regarded as the arch-enemy of the common people,
but his great work has stood the acid test of time. The
German Empire, builded under Bismarck&#8217;s broad ideas may
be likened unto a wonderful watch, in which each part does
its peculiar work without even a gambler&#8217;s chance of going
wrong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The secret discontent of the man who believed himself
sole founder of the German Empire.</p></div>

<p>&para; When the Kaiser, on that eventful day in March, 1890,
turned and told the old man to go, Bismarck received the
heart-breaking sentence without a sign of protest.</p>

<p>&para; To a friend who called he told the news in a calm voice,
a smile on his lips, congratulating himself on being able to
resume his country life, of which he was so fond, of visiting
again the forests on his estates, and &#8220;belonging to himself&#8221;
in the few years that were yet left.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I&#8217;ll soon be gone,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it is time I should take
a rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The story is long and complex, but we will give you the
large details, only. The day comes when Bismarck&#8217;s old
friend, Emperor William I, passes from this earthly scene;
his son, Frederick III, reigns three months and is carried
off by cancer of the throat. The doom of Bismarck is now
sealed! Emperor William I was the firm foundation of Bismarck&#8217;s
strength, but the son did not like the Iron Chancellor,
and within the three brief months of power before death
called, Frederick III let it be known that Bismarck was
marked for retirement. Frederick&#8217;s one act leveled against
the Bismarck family-dynasty was to dismiss von Puttkammer,
Minister of the Interior.</p>

<p>&para; Now enters William II, aged 29, a mighty man in the making,
a sleepless man, one who in his time was to become the
standard by which henceforth all German institutions are to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
be measured. His first address to the army; his second, to
the navy; his third, three days later, to the citizens.</p>

<p>&para; Did he not ask old von Moltke to resign? Yes, and others.
It was not, as many historians set up, that Emperor William
II was jealous of Bismarck, nor was it a case of &#8220;crabbed
age and youth cannot live together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The Emperor, with firm feeling in his will to Imperial
power, wishes to develop Germany along lines of world-wide
importance. Bismarck was of the past; William of the future.
The blow fell March 28th, 1890.</p>

<p>&para; The world gave a gasp of astonishment; it seemed impossible
that Bismarck, the master-mind of United Germany,
should be unceremoniously shuffled out of sight.</p>

<p>Political writers the world around become involved in spirited
controversies, on the whole supporting the old man and
denouncing what seemed like ingratitude on the part of the
new Emperor. It was pointed out that Bismarck himself,
speaking to the Czar, had only a short time before declared,
&#8220;I hope to die in office, always a good friend of Russia.&#8221;
Also that William II had on New Year&#8217;s telegraphed to Bismarck,
&#8220;That I may long be permitted to work with you,
for the welfare and greatness of the Fatherland!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; If Bismarck was not made by a King&#8217;s breath, at least a
breath destroyed Bismarck&#8217;s control of the situation.</p>

<p>Bismarck had long ruled the lives of millions; but when
Wm. II snapped his fingers and said &#8220;Finis!&#8221; the old Chancellor
had to go. The loss of Bismarck&#8217;s influence was as
complete as though instead of being the foremost man of
his time in the diplomatic world, he was instead only a clerk
discharged by his superior.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; In listing the elements on which Bismarck builded there is
always one often overlooked, yet at the very foundation, the
bottom stone in the wall. That one was the favorable attitude
of King William I. Without the King&#8217;s consent, Bismarck&#8217;s
career would have been impossible! Herein, we find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
a classic illustration of how interdependent are men&#8217;s lives;
what small causes sustain or defeat great careers.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; But first we wish to tell you something of his honors during
the past few years, also of the munificent patronage of
the Kaiser, going far to refute the libel that the Kaiser was
ungrateful. The patient Kaiser in truth dealt nobly with
the moody old man.</p>

<p>On the old man&#8217;s 70th birthday (1885), the people of Germany
offered a gift of $1,350,000, one-half of which Bismarck
used to repurchase the ancestral estate, Schoenhausen, which
he had sold in his impecunious years; and now, thanks to the
gratitude of the German nation, the old place, mightily enlarged
and improved, passed again into Bismarck&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>The other half of the $1,350,000 Bismarck set aside as an
endowment fund for school teachers.</p>

<p>&para; Even Victor Hugo added his hero-worship, in this curious
letter: &#8220;The giant salutes the giant! The enemy salutes the
enemy! The friend sends the greeting of a friend!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I hate you, cruelly, for you have humiliated France; I
love you because I am greater than you.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;You kept silence when my eighty years sounded from the
belfry of my glory; but I speak now because the stolen clock
which stands upon your desk, refuses to announce to you
that your 70th birthday has come.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;If you and I were united in one person, the history of the
world would have been ended.... But you are great because
you know not what fear is. Therefore, I, the poet,
offer my hand to you, the great man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; The Prince, thunderstruck, wrote in reply two words, &#8220;Otto&mdash;Adieu!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Nor was this all. The Pope bestowed upon Bismarck the
Order of Christ, for ameliorating the last of certain hard
conditions against the Church, dating from the culture-struggle
of years gone by.</p>

<p>&para; In 1871, Emperor William I had invested Bismarck with
the hereditary dignity of Prince, and William II conferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
on Bismarck, at the time of dismissal (1890), the title Duke
of Lauenburg, together with a larger share of the Duchy of
Lauenburg, an estate on which the Emperor expended $1,000,000.</p>

<p>&para; The old man&#8217;s income was now said to be in excess of $100,000
a year; in addition he received unnumbered gifts of a
princely nature, as well as priceless tokens of sentimental
esteem, from patriotic Germans the world around.</p>

<p>&para; It was a relief to Bismarck, in his old age, to know that
his family would be rich and famous. He had been deeply
engrossed in politics for years, and all his ambitions had been
exhausted on his beloved Germany; he not only had no time
to make money, but was heavily in debt; his interest account,
for loans, was said to have been, for many years, $30,000 per
annum.</p>

<p>How he managed to keep his head above water (with all the
distractions of statesmanship, to say nothing of the burdens
of three great wars, and the embarrassments of his private
finances) shows the man&#8217;s iron constitution as well as his
sagacity in practical affairs.</p>

<p>&para; In all, Bismarck received forty-eight orders of distinction,
at the hands of monarchs; also a long list of university degrees,
medals and golden keys bestowing the freedom of
German cities.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The immediate cause of Bismarck&#8217;s dismissal had to do
with an old &#8220;Order in Council,&#8221; 1852, to the effect that the
Prime Minister, as head of the Prussian Cabinet, had autocratic
powers.</p>

<p>This order the Kaiser now abruptly countermanded. The decision
was made following an interview between Bismarck
and Dr. Windhorst, at Bismarck&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>William II did not much like this political jockeying on the
part of Bismarck; Windhorst was an enemy of the established
order; therefore, that the Prussian Chancellor should
hold a secret caucus with a politician objectionable to the
Emperor created a crisis.</p>

<p>The Kaiser, who lived in a wire-hung whispering gallery,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
knew at once that Bismarck and Windhorst had been in conference;
and early on the day following, William abruptly
appeared at Bismarck&#8217;s and asked to see the Chancellor.</p>

<p>Bismarck came down in morning gown and slippers, for he
had been summoned from his bed!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;What is the meaning of this Windhorst interview?&#8221; inquired
the Kaiser sharply.</p>

<p>Bismarck replied with spirit. The breach widened. Bismarck
took the ground that it was none of the Kaiser&#8217;s business
who called at the Bismarck house.</p>

<p>&para; The Kaiser then insisted that in the future he should be
notified in advance of prospective political interviews, that, if
he so desired, he might send a personal representative, to
report the drift of the talk.</p>

<p>This made Bismarck furious; the old man rebelled, flatly!</p>

<p>&para; It was a sharp, short, painful scene; by no means a ceremonious
discussion of constitutional prerogatives, or the amicable
rearrangement of methods of transacting state business.
Instead, it was the parting of the ways, the breaking
of old ties;&mdash;and after all these long years!</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Then I understand, Your Majesty, that I am in your way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Haste!&#8221; rejoined the Kaiser; and thus, in few words, the
celebrated interview came to an end.</p>

<p>&para; In parting with the Chancellor, the Kaiser made Bismarck
Prince of Lauenburg and gave him a very valuable country
estate, and added also the rank of Field Marshal. The princes
of Germany joined in good wishes for the old man&#8217;s peace
and happiness, for his declining days.</p>

<p>&para; Peace and happiness&mdash;what a satire!</p>



<h5><a name="s64" id="s64"></a>64</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And Bismarck was intensely human! &#8220;Who made
United Germany?&#8221; is his question.</p></div>

<p>&para; The women of his household did not take the news quietly.</p>

<p>&para; The imperial messenger arrived with the Kaiser&#8217;s portrait,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
as a farewell souvenir to Prince Bismarck. His wife exclaimed:
&#8220;Take it to Friedrichsruh and let it be placed in
the stable!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; At the depot, a great crowd came to see the old man depart
for the country, but the Kaiser was not there.</p>

<p>Bismarck&#8217;s hoary age, his great dignity, his known services
to Germany, were now dear to the heart of Germans; thousands
gathered, in spontaneous farewell, crowding around the
old man and kissing his hand.</p>

<p>&para; Now let us face the facts.</p>

<p>To a man of Bismarck&#8217;s iron mold, the exercise of power
is the breath of life; this made it a tragedy for the aged
Bismarck to withdraw.</p>

<p>It was but natural for him, as time passed and his ambition
grew, that he should believe himself the sole founder of the
German Empire. His constant utterances after his downfall
bear out this idea. The composite victory of scores of minds
merged in his imagination and now crystallized in his own
soul victory. Such is human nature, and so we say &#8220;Wellington
won the Battle of Waterloo,&#8221; but is this strictly true?
True or false, such is human habit of thought, and Bismarck
was also now shown to be human enough to claim it all for
himself.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The story of Wolsey over again; our old counsellor of state
thrown off in his declining years; and we can almost hear
Bismarck in his great bitterness repeat the tragic words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had I but serv&#8217;d my God with half the zeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I serv&#8217;d my King, he would not in my age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have left me naked to mine enemies!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s further official presence was irksome to the new
master. With the iron decision characteristic of Hohenzollern,
William II ended the situation, with a stroke of his
imperial will. In this attitude William not only acted wisely,
but showed himself every inch a Kaiser.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Besides, Bismarck was plotting in a very human way to
support and advance the rising fortunes of the Bismarck
family. Would you not have done as much, or even more?</p>

<p>In his princely office, Bismarck thought to found a diplomatic
dynasty of his own, wherein the servant becomes the master;
he made his son, young Count Herbert, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, a rise in life prodigiously fast for one who used to
fill the function of holding his father&#8217;s dispatch bag in the
Parliament, when the old man made speeches, supported by
incessant drinking of brandy.</p>

<p>Bismarck, himself, was Chancellor, Minister-President, Foreign
Minister; his cousin, Minister of the Interior; and there
were many other Bismarcks in state service, trained to know
the old man&#8217;s policy. Constructive governmental work was
all in Bismarck&#8217;s power;&mdash;and he meant to keep it there.</p>

<p>&para; These many acts of family favoritism, arousing the indignation
of the new Emperor, played an important part in
determining the old man&#8217;s dismissal. The King was offended
by Bismarck&#8217;s many acts of nepotism, &#8220;the greatest,&#8221; he secretly
declared, &#8220;which politics have ever recorded.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; A high official said to Bismarck after Koeniggraetz: &#8220;You
should be well satisfied;&mdash;it made you a Prince!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;It made me a Prince,&#8221; mused Bismarck, with a sudden
and unaccountable show of irony. Then, pointing to the map
of United Germany, he replied with deep-rooted conviction
that revealed how the fires of ambition were consuming his
very soul: &#8220;A Prince, did you say? Yes, there is my principality!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; From that hour, the suspicious and irrascible side of Bismarck&#8217;s
mind continued to expand. Some of us quarrel with
our family, our partners, or our political party, asking who
was responsible for the disaster, but the most deadly disputes
are those called forth by ambition to decide not who
was responsible for the loss, but who made the success.</p>

<p>&para; Small cause; great effect.</p>

<p>&para; And Bismarck was intensely human!</p>



<h5><a name="s65" id="s65"></a>65<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The elements of his greatness number three&mdash;Here
read two, but the third and greatest is yet to come.</p></div>

<p>&para; Now you ought to begin to understand the man in his
naked reality; his elements of greatness compounded with
crying frailties&mdash;but his very faults endear him to us the
more, because they show him brother to the weak.</p>

<p>&para; Threefold a great man, great in ambition and courage;
greater in compelling victory through years of patient and
moody planning; but greatest of all in his downfall, when
turning his back upon the blaze of glory, he retires to the
country to view the mighty forests, and to take long walks
with his dogs over the fields, communing with himself, the
winds of heaven, and the immortal stars.</p>

<p>&para; His time is now very short; the sands have all but run out
of the glass. For the first time in many, many years, he
now belongs to himself once more&mdash;on the very edge of the
tomb&mdash;before the sun is to go out forever&mdash;and the long
night settles down.</p>

<p>&para; Does he still believe in his old ikon? In the secret chamber
of his heart does he still believe that God was behind
it all, on the side of the needle-guns of Sadowa?</p>

<p>&para; The justifications of earth ofttimes betray themselves in
strange superstitions, and there always was a large strain
of superstition compounded in the great mind of this great
man; not unlike the superstitions of a brother conqueror, Julius
C&aelig;sar, who was wont to crawl on his belly to the Temple,
there to return thanks to the immortal gods for success
in battle.</p>

<p>&para; To his dying day, Otto von Bismarck held fast that he was
the instrument of God, and that God did it all, through him.
Flesh and blood needs some explanation for its ways&mdash;and
it may be that one interpretation is on the whole as good as
another. With Bismarck the ikon was God.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; On his part, as a human being, for many years Bismarck
nursed his seemingly impossible dream of expelling Austria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
from the German states and binding up thirty-nine principalities
in one grand Empire. This ambition he pursued
incessantly, and ultimately succeeded in reaching by his
genius in manipulating the human nature side of the men
around him. He worked for himself, for his King and for
his ideal of a United Germany. He gave to the seemingly
hopeless cause all his time, strength, nay, his very soul.</p>

<p>&para; His was also now the secret discontent of a man who
thought himself the sole founder of the German Empire. It
was so understood by Kaiser William. For the time being,
then, the patient Kaiser, averse to wounding the pride of a
true German servant of the Empire, permitted the overleaping
ambition of his great Minister of State to have sway;
but William knew that, soon or late, the break must come;
and in his own mind had already decided on the man who
was to take Bismarck&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>&para; Little by little threats came; men in high office secretly
inveighed against Bismarck&#8217;s new ambitions; it did not escape
the attention of the Emperor&#8217;s intriguers, who now worked
against the old man&#8217;s family aspirations; then came more
resolute attitudes on Bismarck&#8217;s part, egged on by his wife
and by his son, who each had grown prodigiously ambitious.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Enter General Caprivi!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Before the will of the Kaiser, Bismarck must bow; and now
behold how the mighty has fallen! We must henceforth seek
him not in the splendid halls of state, but among simple rural
scenes in Schoenhausen, where he was born, where he lived
as a child; and to these quiet shades under the oaks and
elms he now returns at the last remove of life; a broken,
world-weary man, full of honors it is true, but by the irony
of fate come back to die stripped of worldly grandeur, and
to ponder the vanity of all earthly ambitions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bismarck inveighs against the ingratitude of kings&mdash;A

it. With all the querulous impatience of an octogenarian,

swollen veins, in short, a crabbed old man, awaiting the call&mdash;behold

<p>&para; On one occasion he moodily replied to a question: &#8220;Who are
the Hohenzollerns? My family is as good as theirs!&#8221; And
the old man meant it, every word of it.</p>

<p>&para; He began bombarding the newspapers with bitter reviews,
criticising the Government, the affairs of the day. The African
treaty he dissected, to Caprivi&#8217;s disadvantage. &#8220;I never
would have signed it!&#8221; wrote Bismarck, and the press took up
the cry. Any utterance from the old political sage was welcomed,
the more caustic the criticism the better it read, all
to the disadvantage of the Emperor and the new advisers.</p>

<p>&para; Many newspaper reporters called at Bismarck&#8217;s country
retreat; the old man would tell them strong truths against
the Government. Here and there, a newspaper came out as
Bismarck&#8217;s official spokesman!</p>

<p>&para; It did seem as though nothing Caprivi did ever pleased the
old man.</p>

<p>The curious fact was this: that Bismarck in his own time
had always held as an inviolable principle, &#8220;No criticism of
the Government in foreign affairs,&#8221; but now he claimed a
privilege he had never granted to another.</p>

<p>&para; One of his many startling confessions of state secrets was
that the Franco-Prussian war never would have taken place
but for the garbled Ems dispatch. Instead of being a &#8220;holy
war,&#8221; to support the very life of the Fatherland, it was now
made clear that the old Divine-right idea had been but the
stage-play of a political minister, for his imperial sovereign&#8217;s
march to glory.</p>

<p>&para; The last illusion was now dispelled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Caprivi was obliged to issue a circular-letter to Germany&#8217;s
diplomatic corps, everywhere, &#8220;Do not mind Bismarck&#8217;s utterances;
take no stock in them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Even when Bismarck&#8217;s old friend, von Moltke, died, the Man
of Iron refused to go to the funeral; he did not care to take
a chance of meeting the Emperor, there!</p>

<p>&para; Querulous, iron-willed&mdash;such he is to remain. No giving up,
no softening, no forgiveness; but blood and iron to the end.
We must present him thus, our sad-hearted, irritable old master,
proclaiming against the vanity of earthly glories, and
like Wolsey wondering on the frailties and ingratitude of
kings, whose memories are indeed no longer than the going
down of the sun.</p>

<p>&para; Thus for two long weary years the bitter fight went on.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The old man now went on a trip to Vienna, to see his son
Herbert married, but ahead of him the Government had
telegraphed, &#8220;No official welcome for Bismarck!&#8221;</p>

<p>The German ambassador, under instructions from Berlin, did
not dare attend the wedding, refused to notice Bismarck&#8217;s
presence in Vienna, officially.</p>

<p>&para; This was the last straw; it worked revulsion of popular
feeling; the common people of Germany, the self-same people
that Bismarck had so long doubted, now took up arms for
fair play for the old man; and Caprivi, made the scapegoat,
was forced to resign. He was succeeded by Hohenlohe, Bismarck&#8217;s
friend, and leader in the Bavarian National party.</p>

<p>&para; On Bismarck&#8217;s eightieth birthday, the Emperor came in
person, and with military honors presented the old man with
a magnificent sword; but on Bismarck&#8217;s part the reconciliation
was not sincere, you may well imagine that.</p>

people, whom the great Bismarck so long politically
ignored, now do indeed bind up the old man&#8217;s
wounds.</p></div>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s mighty nature never softened, but remained
bitter to the day of his death, with fire and sword pursuing
his enemies; broken by Fate, his power gone, Bismarck still
continued consistent to the last; true to his iron nature, he
returned the hatred of enemies with his own arrogant contempt.</p>

<p>&para; As the years of his downfall passed and men came to comprehend
somewhat his extraordinary combination of overshadowing
political genius in administrative and executive
life, side by side with his strange superstitions and his many
weaknesses of a grand order, this awe-inspiring man became
beloved for his frailties by the very common people whom
all his life long he had held under suspicion. The people rallied
to his defense when kings quitted his side; they took
up his cause because the old man had been outraged in his
sensibilities, rather than because he was right; they sent
him thousands of sympathetic letters, telegrams, presents;
thousands of students, business men, women and children,
visited him in his retirement; and by that touch of human
nature that proves the world kin, took the embittered old man
to their hearts in the name of the United Germany that he
had created with toil so infinite and battlings so long and
blood-stained;&mdash;and they disarmed Bismarck by honoring the
name of their old enemy.</p>

<p>&para; It is a wonderful story of human nature, this story of how
the German people rallied to Bismarck&#8217;s side; a story that
reaffirms how slender after all is the space between the
pomp of kings and the obscure destiny of the shepherd on
the hills.</p>

<p>The proud figure of the grand old man who was not too high
to fall from power stands side by side with Marius at the
ruins of Carthage.</p>

faithfully and who abandoned him at last, and the people
whom he despised but who rallied to his side and bound up
his wounds, this courageous giant, who during the long years
in which he fronted the seemingly forlorn struggle for United
Germany, had been so conscientious in the discharge of his
unpleasant duties, came at last to his peculiar eminence as
one of the world&#8217;s greatest characters.</p>

<p>&para; When he came to die, full of years and honors, although
he had no National funeral like the magnificent outpouring
that marked the return of Napoleon&#8217;s body to the banks of
the River Seine, yet in the hearts of the German people Otto
von Bismarck was accorded the grandest funeral of modern
times, if not of all time.</p>

<p>That was many years ago; but his unapproachable memory
still lives, as Father of United Germany&mdash;and his fame goes
marching on.</p>

gives orders like a military man, is a believer in diet, and
all that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Twenty years before, when Bismarck&#8217;s weight was 247, this
South German Dr. Schweninger put Bismarck through a
course of &#8220;banting,&#8221; and the Chancellor rewarded the doctor
with a chair in Berlin, against the united protests of the
faculty! Why, yes, bring up Dr. Schweninger; he can make
me well, I am sure.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;I can make you live to be ninety, Prince!&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Then get to work; spare no time; I am in bad shape!&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Letters, telegrams, felicitations in the form of magnificently
embossed diplomas, continue to come, day after day;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Bismarck is given the freedom of cities; he is enrolled among
engineers, carpenters, brewers, ship-masters, tailors; each
guild demands that the Iron Chancellor&#8217;s name head the list
of honorary officers of the Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>In one year the record shows 650,000 letters and 10,000 telegrams;
and among these are begging letters asking a total
of $2,500,000!</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck often grows tired of seeing visitors; he has
built himself a secret spiral staircase, hidden in an unexpected
place; and uses it against unwelcome callers.</p>

<p>Now and then, when his health permits, he is at his editorial
work again, laboriously issuing his proclamations to the German
people; he writes with a quill pen, and for a blotter prefers
the old-time box of blue sand.</p>

<p>For scribbling hasty notes, he prefers huge lead pencils, such
as he favored in parliamentary days; pencils 15 inches long,
similar to those used by German carpenters.</p>

<p>He sits at an immense oak table, and his chair seems uncomfortable;
it has no back.</p>

<p>At his side is his porcelain tobacco jar, two feet tall, and
on the stand are innumerable pipes, which in turn are filled
and smoked, all day long. He holds a sort of tobacco parliament
every day. Visitors must smoke a pipe or cigars, drink
wine, meet the dogs, and hear the old man inveigh against
these degenerate times.</p>

<p>&para; Those big Ulmar dogs are always around him. At meal
times, no matter how fashionable the company, Bismarck
pauses at the end of the dinner to throw &#8220;Sultana&#8221; or &#8220;Cyrus&#8221;
a biscuit!</p>

<p>Sometimes he wears his Cuirassier&#8217;s uniform, this broad-shouldered
giant with the thick neck and the grizzled mustache;
his eyes glower under his thick white brows, and in
the depths of his faded blue eyes is the old look of determination.</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s face is ashen grey, but he still has the stamp
of immense dignity, a colossal personality, unquestionably
representing the first public man of his time.</p>

<p>Folks bow to him, and he is master to the end; men are his
servants, not his companions.</p>

<p>&para; He is always very deliberate; he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>has a peculiar way of
stopping in the middle of a sentence to seek out in a moment
of silence the exact word he needs.</p>

<p>&para; In the morning, he usually takes a stroll with his big dogs.
It was a shock when &#8220;Old William&#8221; died, and the Emperor
then gave Bismarck &#8220;Cyrus&#8221;; the Prince also had &#8220;Rebecca&#8221;
and &#8220;Sultana.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ulmar dogs, following the old giant, resemble tigers in
their powerful slouching gait.</p>

<p>At night they sleep in his bedroom.</p>



<h5><a name="s69" id="s69"></a>69</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bismarck refuses to pass under the yoke&mdash;the octogenarian&#8217;s
last struggle of ambition.</p></div>

<p>&para; He has his superstitions to the end; about the number 13,
about the number 7; and he believes that the moon has power
to make human hair grow. &#8220;It is best,&#8221; he says, &#8220;not to make
scoff of such matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Sometimes he goes over his orders of honor, forty-eight in
all, and of great distinction; also, his learned degrees. University
of Halle made him Doctor of Philosophy; Erlangen,
Doctor of Law; Tuebingen, Doctor of Political Science; Giessen,
Doctor of Theology, and Jena, Six-fold Doctor, that is
to say Doctor of Medicine; and Goettingen, Doctor of Law.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; They bring him a joint of wild boar, shot in Varzin forest,
and he has a feast. His fondness for game he never gives up.
Also, to the last he has his champagne. After the Franco-Prussian
war Bismarck refused to drink German champagne,
and told the Emperor, quite plainly, &#8220;Your Majesty, my patriotism
stops with my stomach; I simply must stick to
French champagnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; He tells how he used to drink Affenthaler and Merkgraefler,
years before at Frankfort; these were first-rate, at one florin
a bottle, or wholesale, the old man explains; by the 100 liters,
only 14 kreutzers (8 cents) a bottle.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Red wine is for children, champagne for ladies, and
schnapps for generals,&#8221; is one of his drinking m<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>ottoes, but he
tells that he himself prefers his old-line invention, the Bismarck
champagne and porter, a most powerful decoction,
putting ordinary mortals under the table very early in the
evening&mdash;but not the Iron Chancellor, not at all!</p>

<p>&para; He recalls amusing stories of his ancestors. &#8220;One ancestor
put pigs&#8217; ears in pea soup and made a gastronomic hit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s eyes water one day and he explains, &#8220;The wine
my ancestors drank to excess comes back in punishment for
their sins.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; What do you think? Bismarck&#8217;s old enemy, Herr von
Sybel, the eminent author of the ponderous &#8220;History of Prussia,&#8221;
called today, and Bismarck was glad to see Sybel, and
they chatted a long time. As he and Sybel talked of history,
Bismarck had moments when he held himself the one authentic
builder of the German Empire.</p>

<p>&para; Gradually, he came to think that he alone of his own unaided
might did the work.</p>

<p>&para; Last scene of all in this great drama of Bismarck! The
octogenarian, in his downfall, is bitterly storming against
his enemies.</p>

<p>Consistent to the end, he never weakened. He did not pass
under the yoke of defeat by revealing any of those soft virtues
that writers who make a wax doll of this mighty man
would have us believe.</p>

<p>He raged and stormed impotently in his retirement at Friedrichsruh,
and by every loud and insulting means in his power&mdash;by
voice, pen, by special interviews, in his private letters,
in his telegraphic dispatches, in his talks with the old
friends or new callers, and to the last scratch of his Memoirs&mdash;Bismarck
remains unrepentant, turbulent, to the end fighting
bitterly against the Fate to which he could not and would
not submit.</p>

<p>Temperamentally and psychologically, it was impossible for
him to act in any way other than that in which he did act&mdash;even
as you, in your own life, are true to yourself in storm
and sunshine, following some unformulated but idiomatic
law of your being.</p>

<p>Bismarck believed himself a chosen instrument in the hands
of God and tenaciously clung to the d<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>ominant idea that the
Bismarck work comprised all the raw materials of German
history, affecting the German Empire.</p>


<h5><a name="s70" id="s70"></a>70</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>His face is ashen, his grizzled mustache, eyebrows
and hair white as the driven snow.</p></div>

<p>&para; On the whole, the old man is interested in events not in
persons; he does not keep track of individuals; but he studies
their work and its effects.</p>

<p>So, in his retirement he talks of big events, mostly; all the
while suffers from fits of depression and exhibits a growing
moroseness, a peculiar characteristic of highly developed
German character.</p>

<p>He calls for Kant, Hegel, Christ; and reads them, deeply.
He likes Hegel&#8217;s idea that the history of the world shows
&#8220;rational order,&#8221; conceals a &#8220;manifest destiny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; But the old man&#8217;s one consolation is the Book of Job.</p>

<p>He lays awake o&#8217; nights, unable to sleep, he says, &#8220;and it
seems as though there were a mountain on my chest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; He does not think much of Gladstone&#8217;s &#8220;Home Rule&#8221; ideas;
this &#8220;let the people&#8221; rule is bad business, is the old man&#8217;s
comment.</p>

<p>&para; He is invited out a great deal, but always makes the same
excuse, &#8220;I do not sleep well anywhere except in my own four-post
bed. My traveling days are over, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; One day in the park, the ladies kissed his hand, but he replied
by kissing their cheeks, and he made a little speech as
though he were in parliament.</p>

<p>&para; He studies the thick walls of Schoenhausen mansion and
examines the old French cannon of &#8217;71 scattered around the
yard, as souvenirs.</p>

<p>&para; He superintends the planting of trees; and rules over his
estate with all the old family dignity and unshaken firmness
of soul. He asks his secretary to count the telegrams that
came this past year and in round numbers there are 10,000.
The old man takes a notion to send each inquirer after his
health a Bismarck autograph. So each day, from April to
August, he spends part of his time writing over and over
in great scrawling letters, at the bottom of a printed card
of t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>hanks, the huge signature, &#8220;Bismarck.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Little things are beginning to bother the old man. He
comes in today from a short walk and says he hates crows,
because they are the enemy of the singing birds.</p>

<p>&para; Neuralgia is tormenting him, day and night, and he is very
irritable.</p>

<p>School children come with teachers and after the children
sing the old man bows and says, &#8220;Children, I thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&para; And this Dr. Schweninger, who promised Bismarck ninety
years of life, is always hovering about, like a military doctor,
giving express orders to eat this, to get up at such an hour,
to go to bed at such an hour, and to take a nap at such an
hour.</p>

<p>The old man obeys like a child.</p>

<p>&para; Strangers wait at the village bridge to see Bismarck and
his dogs pass by; week after week delegations of working-men,
lawyers, students, come to the house.</p>

<p>Schweninger orders him to take longer naps, not worry about
politics and not to meet strangers. The old saying, &#8220;Once a
man and twice a child&#8221; is coming to pass; Otto von Bismarck
is no longer the stubborn, dogmatic fellow that he was, even
a few years ago. But he still scolds, fights and has his way
with all&mdash;except the doctor.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Tomorrow, April 1, 1898, Bismarck will be 83; however, he
does not seem to be failing much; but his face is ashen, his
grizzled mustache, eyebrows and hair are as white as the
driven snow.</p>

<p>&para; Gardeners write to him that they have named their choicest
new variety of rose, the Bismarck; and cigarmakers have the
Bismarck shape, cutlers the Bismarck dinner knife, a thick,
sharp blade that will carve a duck&#8217;s neck in a twinkling.</p>

<p>&para; However, the old man is growing weary of it all; and he
hears with no great show of interest that the people are
planning monuments everywhere. There is going to be an
equestrian, helmeted statue in the market place at Leipzig;
at Weringrode, a heroic-sized Bismarck will lean upon a
sword; there will be a column in Hartzburg, Victory with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
lyre and another Victory with a wreath; there is to be a
statue at Kissingen; a helmeted-heroic figure at Freiberg; a
column at Charlotte-springs; a column at Meiszen; at
Cologne, a heroic figure with a sword; a heroic &#8220;Tyras and
Bismarck,&#8221; dog and man, at Leipzig; allegorical figures,
&#8220;Glory and War,&#8221; for Berlin; at Wiesbaden, a statue symbolizing
the Bismarck National victory; a bust at Heidelberg;
at Kreuznach; a heroic figure with helmet and sword,
with &#8220;Glory&#8221; at his feet; at Zwickau, an allegorical memorial
of noble proportions; a tower in the Black Forest; and still
another at Altona.</p>

<p>&para; No; it is no use! As we said before, the old man is growing
very weary of it all; and now along comes Arthur Mendell,
who paints for posterity that remarkable Bismarck in
which you see only the blazing eyes and the shining silver
helmet&mdash;the Bismarck of the brave days of &#8217;66 and &#8217;70,
when the German hosts carrying their deadly needle-guns,
marched over the Rhine&mdash;at Bismarck&#8217;s word!</p>

<p>&para; Dear Old Bismarck, these wreaths of immortelles come to
you in your retirement, but you have reached the time when
the grasshopper has become a burden, and when you have but
one wish left in this world&mdash;and that wish is to go in peace
to your long sleep.</p>

<p>&para; Coming, Bismarck&mdash;coming very soon now, Old Soldier;
and we know well how courageously you will answer up,
when the invisible Skeleton in Armor calls your imperial
name!</p>




<h4><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h4>

<h3>Hail and Farewell</h3>


<h5><a name="s71" id="s71"></a>71</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Prince Otto V. Bismarck receives his final and his
one glorious decoration; and here we leave him, his
fame secure among Germany&#8217;s immortals.</p></div>

<p>&para; The game is now all but played out. The last phase is
to be the noblest expression.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p>In his prime, Bismarck was of massive proportions in mind
and body; but of his moral nature both friends and enemies
had often been in doubt for many years. Now, even that was
revealed to be in concord with his herculean bulk.</p>

<p>&para; The old glory passed from him, like a dream. He committed
his soul to his God; and he heard again voices of
Nature that had been inaudible to him, during his many
years of intriguing diplomacy.</p>

<p>These voices spoke to him of the vanity and emptiness of
human life, of the worthless baubles for which men exchange
all they have, that is to say, their immortal gift of time,
which soon passes away and is no more.</p>

<p>The musings of the Prince on the follies, inconsistencies and
ambitions of life conspire to create a heroic figure like King
Solomon. All is vanity! The conqueror of a continent has
so declared. He had held the world in his hand, and had
found that the sphere is hollow.</p>

<p>So go the fates of men.</p>

<p>&para; The great Prince Bismarck has now become as a beggar at
the city&#8217;s gates.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Over his grand spectacle of human pomp and power, contrasted
with his final self-abnegation, shining forth we see
the heights and depths of human life; but in this case the
end was greater than the beginning; the defeat than the
victory; the downfall than the glory; and the disillusion than
the dream.</p>

<p>&para; Prince Bismarck in his long career as friend and confidant
of the kings of this earth, had been honored with forty-eight
orders of distinction. It is needless to mention them all, but
they included the Iron Cross and the Order of Merit, the one
entitling him to sit with kings, the other to command an
army corps.</p>

<p>&para; But the greatest decoration of all was the one he now wore,
his high tide of glory gone.</p>

<p>It is the Decoration of the Order of the Disillusioned, bestowed
upon himself by his own soul.</p>

<p>Soon or late, prince or pauper, and you and I, wear this Order
as at last we sit and wonder at the years gone by.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>&para; Let us silently pass on, leaving Bismarck here, in the one
solemn moment of his life; when he attains to real grandeur,
stamps himself as greater than when he sat before kings.</p>

<p>For now he possesses his own soul, in peace.</p>

<p>And in this last picture, the end is greater than the beginning;
the defeat than the victory; the downfall than the
glory; and the disillusion than the dream.</p>

<p>&para; His final consolation was the Book of Job; and he read
therein these strange and solemn words:</p>

<p>&para; What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine
end, that I should prolong my life?</p>

<p>Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh of brass?</p>

<p>&para; So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome
nights are appointed to me.</p>

<p>When I lie down, I say, when shall I arise, and the night be
gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro, unto the dawning
of the day.</p>

<p>My days are swifter than a weaver&#8217;s shuttle, and are spent
without hope.</p>

<p>&para; Yea, man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
I would seek unto God and unto God would I commit my
cause;</p>

<p>Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvelous things
without number;</p>

<p>Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon
the fields;</p>

<p>To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn
may be exalted to safety.</p>

<p>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
hands cannot perform their enterprise.</p>

<p>&para; Behold happy is the man whom God correcteth; therefore
despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty;</p>

<p>For he maketh sore and bindeth up; he woundeth and his
hands make whole.</p>

<p>He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall
be no evil touch thee.</p>

<p>In famine, he shall redeem thee from death; and in war from
the power of the sword ... neither shalt thou be afraid

<h5><a name="s72" id="s72"></a>72</h5>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;As One Asleep&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&para; On July 30, 1898, just before midnight, Otto Edward Leopold
von Bismarck, Prince of Lauenburg and former Imperial
Chancellor of the German Empire, died peacefully in the old
homestead of his ancestors.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of death was congestion of the lungs.</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;Ich danke Dir, mein Kind,&#8221; were his last words, addressed
to his daughter, who had stooped to wipe the moisture from
his pale brow.</p>

<p>&para; As late as the day he died, he had read the newspapers and
talked politics.</p>

<p>His final remarks were on the relations of Germany and
Russia, at all times a subject of deep concern to him.</p>

<p>&para; Dr. Schweninger had promised to bring him to 90&mdash;and was
seven years short.</p>

<p>But the Bismarck of retirement was not unhappy in the taking
off; he had grown tired of it all; and it is pleasant to
record that his last hours were without pain.</p>

<p>&para; A few days before, he had had his champagne, and had
smoked five pipes in succession; also the day before he died,
he had asked an attendant to &#8220;color&#8221; two new meerschaums,
gifts of friends. Toward the last, he had used an invalid&#8217;s
chair for breakfast, but otherwise he seemed as well as could
be expected.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; The windows looking upon the garden were opened, early
next morning, and the servants of the household gathered
there to look at the master, at rest.</p>

<p>He was seemingly asleep in his four-poster bed, his head
slightly inclined to the left; his expression was that of one
gently dreaming; his arms were resting over the coverlet,
and in his left hand he held one white and three red roses, a
last love-token from an Austrian lady.</p>

<p>&para; Th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>e expression of his features was, at the end, proud and
noble; but the face was as grey as ashes; for the fire of life
was out at last!</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Later, came two Cuirassiers, in white, with drawn swords;
and these massive figures stood there by the bedside, and by
and by kept solemn guard beside the coffin; also, near by
were two Foresters, in green.</p>

<p>&para; Books, papers, telegrams and a laurel wreath were in the
death chamber, where the master had worked to the end.</p>

<p>Not far away was his favorite chessboard, also, within touch
the Emperor&#8217;s last present, a fac-simile of Frederick the
Great&#8217;s great crook-headed gold cane; a step the other way
the globe of the earth that Bismarck used to roll over with
his big hand, when he studied his endless foreign political
combinations.</p>

<p>&para; Later, came the magnificent funeral with the high military,
and all the rest; but we think we shall take leave of him in
his old room with these simple objects around him, his tools
of work, his big oak desk, his mounds of state papers, his
writings, his quill pens, his box of blue sand, his pipes, steins
and champagne glasses, his letters, his telegrams, his great
heaps of books, his immense correspondence on the affairs of
nations, his diplomas from universities, his degrees of law,
philosophy and letters, and finally, his big Ulmar dogs.</p>

<p>&para; Here we leave him as one asleep, reminded of his final
words, uttered when the master was breaking fast with the
infirmities of his eighty-three years:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;There is only one happy day left for me. It is the one
on which I shall not wake again.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; His son refused the request that a death-mask be made of
the noble old face, but Lenbach&#8217;s famous painting will recall
the stern head for years to come.</p>

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s coffin was of polished dark oak, with eight silver
handles in the shape of lion&#8217;s paws; candles burned around
his coffin, the pale lights softened by veils of black and silver
gauze that ornamented the silver candelabra. The floor was
literally covered with wreaths, many bearing cards of sympathy
in gold letters, from various eminent personages
thro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>ughout the world.</p>

<p>&para; The Kaiser heard the funeral services.</p>

<hr />

<p>&para; Bismarck&#8217;s mausoleum rests on a spot Bismarck selected
for himself; a plain Romanesque House of Death against a
background of trees; and to the right still may be seen his
favorite bench where he used to sit, under the shade of
spreading oaks.</p>

<p>The sarcophagus of yellow marble bears this inscription, selected
by Bismarck himself:</p>

<p class="center" style="line-height: 150%">
Here Lies<br />
PRINCE BISMARCK<br />
A Faithful German Servant<br />
of Emperor William I.<br />
</p>

<p>&para; Hostile critics of Germany, brought forth by the great war
of 1914, profess to believe that this inscription on Bismarck&#8217;s
tomb shows that Bismarck did not wish his work to be associated
with the future of the Empire, but with its past.</p>

<p>Instead, it really proclaims the man&#8217;s great mind, his clairvoyant
historical vision. He could have said many things
about himself, touching the great part he played in sustaining
the pomp and majesty of kings; but his simple acknowledgment
of the r&ocirc;le of faithful servant, is more eloquent than
sermons in brass.</p>

<p>&para; Finally, a small altar to the right of the porch carries this
text from Colossians iii:23, the motto given to Bismarck
many, many years before by Rev. Schliermacher, the pastor
who confirmed the boy Otto; and that motto became indeed
Bismarck&#8217;s guiding star through life, as now well you do
know, balancing his record with the solemn Biblical injunction
you read here beside the master&#8217;s tomb:</p>

<p>&para; &#8220;And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and
not unto men.&#8221;</p>
